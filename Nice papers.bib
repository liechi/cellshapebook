abstract = {The Turing, or reaction-diffusion (RD), model is one of the best-known theoretical models used to explain self-regulated pattern formation in the developing animal embryo. Although its real-world relevance was long debated, a number of compelling examples have gradually alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding the model. The RD model can generate a wide variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena. In this review, we describe the essence of this theory for experimental biologists unfamiliar with the model, using examples from experimental studies in which the RD model is effectively incorporated.},

@article{Turing1990,
abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading. {\textcopyright} 1990 Society for Mathematical Biology.},

@article{Hamilton1964,
abstract = {Grounds for thinking that the model described in the previous paper can be used to support general biological principles of social evolution are briefly discussed. Two principles are presented, the first concerning the evolution of social behaviour in general and the second the evolution of social discrimination. Some tentative evidence is given. More general application of the theory in biology is then discussed, particular attention being given to cases where the indicated interpretation differs from previous views and to cases which appear anomalous. A hypothesis is outlined concerning social evolution in the Hymenoptera; but the evidence that at present exists is found somewhat contrary on certain points. Other subjects considered include warning behaviour, the evolution of distasteful properties in insects, clones of cells and clones of zooids as contrasted with other types of colonies, the confinement of parental care to true offspring in birds and insects, fights, the behaviour of parasitoid insect larvae within a host, parental care in connection with monogyny and monandry and multi-ovulate ovaries in plants in connection with wind and insect pollination. {\textcopyright} 1964.},

@article{Hamilton2017,
abstract = {A genetical mathematical model is described which allows for interactions between relatives on one another's fitness. Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named "inclusive fitness." Species following the model should tend to evolve behavior such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behavior and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather nondispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed.},

@article{Milo2002,
abstract = {Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

abstract = {During development, cells undergo a unidirectional course of differentiation that progressively decreases the number of cell types they can potentially become. Stem cells, however, keep their potential to both proliferate and differentiate. A very important issue then is to understand the characteristics that distinguish stem cells from other cell types and allow them to conduct stable proliferation and differentiation. Here, we review relevant dynamical-systems approaches to describe the state transition between stem and differentiated cells, with an emphasis on fluctuating and oscillatory gene expression levels, as these represent the specific properties of stem cells. Relevance between recent experimental results and dynamical-systems descriptions of stem cell differentiation is also discussed.},

@article{Kondo1995,
abstract = {IN 1952, Turing proposed a hypothetical molecular mechanism, called the reaction-diffusion system1, which can develop periodic patterns from an initially homogeneous state. Many theoretical models based on reaction-diffusion have been proposed to account for patterning phenomena in morphogenesis2-4, but, as yet, there is no conclusive experimental evidence for the existence of such a system in the field of biology5-8. The marine angelfish, Pomacanthus has stripe patterns which are not fixed in their skin. Unlike mammal skin patterns, which simply enlarge proportionally during their body growth, the stripes of Pomacanthus maintain the spaces between the lines by the continuous rearrangement of the patterns. Although the pattern alteration varies depending on the conformation of the stripes, a simulation program based on a Turing system can correctly predict future patterns. The striking similarity between the actual and simulated pattern rearrangement strongly suggests that a reaction-diffusion wave is a viable mechanism for the stripe pattern of Pomacanthus. {\textcopyright} 2002 Nature Publishing Group.},
