abstract = {When different tissues successively emerge during development, they need to be morphologically segregated from each other. Morphological segregation of tissues is often accompanied by robust changes in cell shape, and these two events are precisely coordinated. We overview recent progress in understanding how such coordination is regulated at the cellular and molecular levels using vertebrate somitogenesis as a unique model. In the formation of the somitic gap and its concomitant cell epithelialization, Ephrin-Eph intercellular signals play a central role, with Ephrin transducing intracellular signals via suppression of Cdc42. These signals lead to the activation of integrin where the segment border of somites forms, which in turn induces the assembly of fibronectin, the final player for the coordination. Intimate coupling of tissue-shape and cell-shape changes is also relevant to tumor suppression. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (F-actin) function cooperatively to regulate plant cell morphogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems, particularly in cell shape control, remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that introduction of the MyTH4-FERM tandem into KCBP (kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein) during evolution conferred novel functions. The MyTH4 domain and the FERM domain in the N-terminal tail of KCBP physically bind to MTs and F-actin, respectively. During trichome morphogenesis, KCBP distributes in a specific cortical gradient and concentrates at the branching sites and the apexes of elongating branches, which lack MTs but have cortical F-actin. Further, live-cell imaging and genetic analyses revealed that KCBP acts as a hub integrating MTs and actin filaments to assemble the required cytoskeletal configuration for the unique, polarized diffuse growth pattern during trichome cell morphogenesis. Our findings provide significant insights into the mechanisms underlying cytoskeletal regulation of cell shape determination.},

abstract = {The definition of shape in multicellular organisms is a major issue of developmental biology. It is well established that morphogenesis relies on genetic regulation. However, cells, tissues, and organism behaviors are also bound by the laws of physics, which limit the range of possible deformations organisms can undergo but also define what organisms must do to achieve specific shapes. Besides experiments, theoretical models and numerical simulations of growing tissues are powerful tools to investigate the link between genetic regulation and mechanics. Here, we provide an overview of the main mechanical models of plant morphogenesis developed so far, from subcellular scales to whole tissues. The common concepts and discrepancies between the various models are discussed.

abstract = {In plants and fungi, energetics at the plasma membrane is provided by a large protonmotive force (PMF) generated by the family of P-type ATPases specialized for proton transport (commonly called PM H+-ATPases or, in Arabidopsis, AHAs for Arabidopsis H+-ATPases). Studies have demonstrated that this 100-kDa protein is essential for plant growth and development. Posttranslational modifications of the H+-ATPase play crucial roles in its regulation. Phosphorylation of several Thr and Ser residues within the carboxy terminal regulatory domain composed of {\~{}}100 amino acids change in response to environmental stimuli, endogenous hormones, and nutrient conditions. Recently developed mass spectrometric technologies provide a means to carefully quantify these changes in H+-ATPase phosphorylation at the different sites. These chemical modifications can then be genetically tested in planta by complementing the loss-of-function aha mutants with phosphomimetic mutations. Interestingly, recent data suggest that phosphatase-mediated changes in PM H+-ATPase phosphorylation are important in mediating auxin-regulated growth. Thus, as with another hormone (abscisic acid), dephosphorylation by phosphatases, rather than kinase mediated phosphorylation, may be an important focal point for regulation during plant signal transduction. Although interactions with other proteins have also been implicated in ATPase regulation, the very hydrophobic nature and high concentration of this polytopic protein presents special challenges in evaluating the biological significance of these interactions. Only by combining biochemical and genetic experiments can we attempt to meet these challenges to understand the essential molecular details by which this protein functions in planta.},

abstract = {Oriented cell divisions are significant in plant morphogenesis because plant cells are embedded in cell walls and cannot relocate. Cell divisions follow various regular orientations, but the underlying mechanisms have not been clarified. We propose that cell-shape-dependent self-organization of cortical microtubule arrays is able to provide a mechanism for determining planes of early tissue-generating divisions and may form the basis for robust control of cell division orientation in the embryo. To show this, we simulate microtubules on actual cell surface shapes, from which we derive a minimal set of three rules for proper array orientation. The first rule captures the effects of cell shape alone on microtubule organization, the second rule describes the regulation of microtubule stability at cell edges, and the third rule includes the differential effect of auxin on local microtubule stability. These rules generate early embryonic division plane orientations and potentially offer a framework for understanding patterned cell divisions in plant morphogenesis. Chakrabortty et al. show that a computational model for dynamic self-organization of cortical microtubules on experimentally extracted cell shapes provides a plausible molecular mechanism for division plane orientation in the first four divisions of early stage A. thaliana embryos, in WT as well as two developmental mutants bodenlos and clasp.},

It is proposed that these three elements of geometry along with the mitotic spindle and certain cytoplasmic particles constitute an ensemble of structural entities with morphogenetic capacities. Facets, edges and vertices are programmed to assume various states as dictated by the nucleus, and according to the combination of these states within a cell, the cell will express specific patterns of growth, thickening and separation from adjacent cells. A number of examples of cell types in plants and their origins from generalized types of cells are examined by this model and it is recognized that each cell type does not represent a unique behavior but rather expresses a particular combination of changes from a total of about 20 fundamental processes. These five elements of form are viewed as composed of polymers with stereospecific receptors except that the elements collectively are an architectural continuum having both structural and formative features. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

The moss gametophyte has three filamentous tissues that grow by tip growth: chloronemata, caulonemata, and rhizoids. Because establishment of the moss plant relies on this form of growth, it is particularly suited for dissecting the molecular basis of tip growth. Recent studies demonstrate that a core set of actin cytoskeletal proteins is essential for tip growth. Additional actin cytoskeletal components are required for modulating growth to produce caulonemata and rhizoids. Differentiation into these cell types has previously been linked to auxin, light and nutrients. Recent studies have identified that core auxin signaling components as well as transcription factors that respond to auxin or nutrient levels are required for tip-growing cell differentiation. Future studies may establish a connection between the actin cytoskeleton and auxin or nutrient-induced cell differentiation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although much progress has been made in understanding how gene expression patterns are established during development, much less is known about how these patterns are related to the growth of biological shapes. Here we describe conceptual and experimental approaches to bridging this gap, with particular reference to plant development where lack of cell movement simplifies matters. Growth and shape change in plants can be fully described with four types of regional parameter: growth rate, anisotropy, direction, and rotation. A key requirement is to understand how these parameters both influence and respond to the action of genes. This can be addressed by using mechanistic models that capture interactions among three components: regional identities, regionalizing morphogens, and polarizing morphogens. By incorporating these interactions within a growing framework, it is possible to generate shape changes and associated gene expression patterns according to particular hypotheses. The results can be compared with experimental observations of growth of normal and mutant forms, allowing further hypotheses and experiments to be formulated. We illustrate these principles with a study of snapdragon petal growth.},

Using a combination of theory and experiments, we have investigated spindle orientation in HeLa (human) cells. Here we show that spindle orientation can be understood as the result of the action of cortical force generators, which interact with spindle microtubules and are activated by cortical cues. We develop a simple physical description of this spindle mechanics, which allows us to calculate angular profiles of the torque acting on the spindle, as well as the angular distribution of spindle orientations. Our model accounts for the preferred spindle orientation and the shape of the full angular distribution of spindle orientations observed in a large variety of different cellular microenvironment geometries. It also correctly describes asymmetric spindle orientations, which are observed for certain distributions of cortical cues. We conclude that, on the basis of a few simple assumptions, we can provide a quantitative description of the spindle orientation of adherent cells. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

In animal epithelia, conserved junctional complexes establish membrane diffusion barriers, cellular adherence and sealing of the extracellular space. Plant cellular barriers are of independent evolutionary origin. The root endodermis strongly resembles a polarized epithelium and functions in nutrient uptake and stress resistance. Its defining features are the Casparian strips, belts of specialized cell wall material that generate an extracellular diffusion barrier. The mechanisms localizing Casparian strips are unknown. Here we identify and characterize a family of transmembrane proteins of previously unknown function. These 'CASPs' (Casparian strip membrane domain proteins) specifically mark a membrane domain that predicts the formation of Casparian strips. CASP1 displays numerous features required for a constituent of a plant junctional complex: it forms complexes with other CASPs; it becomes immobile upon localization; and it sediments like a large polymer. CASP double mutants display disorganized Casparian strips, demonstrating a role for CASPs in structuring and localizing this cell wall modification. To our knowledge, CASPs are the first molecular factors that are shown to establish a plasma membrane and extracellular diffusion barrier in plants, and represent a novel way of epithelial barrier formation in eukaryotes.},

Cell growth, which is driven by turgor pressure, largely depends on the cell walls, which allow cell expansion through synthesis and structural changes. A previous study revealed a major contribution of wall isotropy in organ emergence, through the disorganization of cortical microtubules. We show here that this disorganization is coupled with the transcriptional control of genes involved in wall remodelling. Some of these genes are induced when microtubules are disorganized and cells shift to isotropic growth. Mechanical modelling shows that this coupling has the potential to compensate for reduced cell expansion rates induced by the shift to isotropic growth. Reciprocally, cell wall loosening induced by different treatments or altered cell wall composition promotes a disruption of microtubule alignment. Our data thus indicate the existence of a regulatory module activated during organ outgrowth, linking microtubule arrangements to cell wall remodelling.},

abstract = {A recently proposed hypothesis [Nick et al. (1990) Planta 181: 162] suggests that, in maize coleoptiles, tropistic curvature might be caused by a stimulus-induced trans-organ gradient over the orientation of cortical microtubules adjacent to the outer cell wall of the outer epidermis. This gradient, in turn, is controlled by a light-induced redistribution of auxin. The hypothesis was tested by following the behaviour of microtubules for various light stimuli using indirect immuno-fiuorescence in epidermal strips as assay. Analysis of gravitropic straightening, nastic curvature on the horizontal clinostat, effects of tonic irradiation with red and/or blue light, and experiments involving opposing light pulses demonstrate that bending direction and microtubule orientation gradients are not as closely linked as predicted: Considerable bending can be produced without detectable gradients of microtubule orientation, and conspicuous gradients of microtubule orientation are not necessarily expressed as corresponding curvature. Thus, a monocausal relationship between microtubules and tropism is excluded. Furthermore, a comparison of tonic light effects on microtubules to earlier studies into the impact of light upon auxin content indicate that the relationship between auxin and microtubules might be more complex than hitherto assumed. It is concluded that, at least in maize coleoptiles, growth can be regulated by various mechanisms, and that microtubules, although somehow related to tropism, are probably not the cause of the fast tropistic responses. {\textcopyright} 1991.

Major advances have been made in our understanding of the signaling pathways and networks that regulate cell polarity in plants owing to recent studies on several model systems, e.g., tip growth in pollen tubes, cell morphogenesis in the leaf epidermis, and polar localization of PINs. From these studies we have learned that plant cells use conserved mechanisms such as Rho family GTPases to integrate both plant-specific and conserved polarity cues and to coordinate the cytoskeketon dynamics/reorganization and vesicular trafficking required for polarity establishment and maintenance. This review focuses upon signaling mechanisms for cell polarity formation in Arabidopsis, with an emphasis on Rho GTPase signaling in polarized cell growth and how these mechanisms compare with those for cell polarity signaling in yeast and animal systems.},

Here we show through 4D imaging and computational modelling that plant cell polyhedral geometry provides spatial input that determines array orientation and heterogeneity. Microtubules depolymerize when encountering sharp cell edges head-on, whereas those oriented parallel to those sharp edges remain. Edge-induced microtubule depolymerization, however, is overcome by the microtubule-associated protein CLASP, which accumulates at specific cell edges, enables microtubule growth around sharp edges and promotes formation of microtubule bundles that span adjacent cell faces. By computationally modelling dynamic 'microtubules on a cube' with edges differentially permissive to microtubule passage, we show that the CLASP-edge complex is a 'tuneable' microtubule organizer, with the inherent flexibility to generate the numerous cortical array patterns observed in nature. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A nuclear auxin-signaling system controlling auxin-induced gene expression is well established, but cytoplasmic auxin signaling, as in its coordination of cell polarization, is unexplored. We found a cytoplasmic auxin-signaling mechanism that modulates the interdigitated growth of Arabidopsis leaf epidermal pavement cells (PCs), which develop interdigitated lobes and indentations to form a puzzle-piece shape in a two-dimensional plane. PC interdigitation is compromised in leaves deficient in either auxin biosynthesis or its export mediated by PINFORMED 1 localized at the lobe tip. Auxin coordinately activates two Rho GTPases, ROP2 and ROP6, which promote the formation of complementary lobes and indentations, respectively. Activation of these ROPs by auxin occurs within 30 s and depends on AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1. These findings reveal Rho GTPase-based auxin-signaling mechanisms, which modulate the spatial coordination of cell expansion across a field of cells. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The forms resulting from growth processes are highly sensitive to the nature of the driving impetus, and to the local properties of the medium, in particular, its isotropy or anisotropy. In turn, these local properties can be organized by growth. Here, we consider a growing plant tissue, the shoot apical meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana. In plants, the resistance of the cell wall to the growing internal turgor pressure is the main factor shaping the cells and the tissues. It is well established that the physical properties of the walls depend on the oriented deposition of the cellulose microfibrils in the extracellular matrix or cell wall; this order is correlated to the highly oriented cortical array of microtubules attached to the inner side of the plasma membrane. We used oryzalin to depolymerize microtubules and analyzed its influence on the growing meristem. This had no short-term effect, but it had a profound impact on the cell anisotropy and the resulting tissue growth. The geometry of the cells became similar to that of bubbles in a soap froth. At a multicellular scale, this switch to a local isotropy induced growth into spherical structures. A theoretical model is presented in which a cellular structure grows through the plastic yielding of its walls under turgor pressure. The simulations reproduce the geometrical properties of a normal tissue if cell division is included. If not, a "cell froth" very similar to that observed experimentally is obtained. Our results suggest strong physical constraints on the mechanisms of growth regulation.},

abstract = {A fundamental and unresolved problem in animal development is the question of how a growing tissue knows when it has achieved its correct final size. A widely held view suggests that this process is controlled by morphogen gradients, which adapt to tissue size and become flatter as tissue grows, leading eventually to growth arrest. Here, we present evidence that the decapentaplegic (Dpp) morphogen distribution in the developing Drosophila wing imaginal disk does not adapt to disk size. We measure the distribution of a functional Dpp-GFP transgene and the Dpp signal transduced by phospho-Mad and show that the characteristic length scale of the Dpp profile remains approximately constant during growth. This finding suggests an alternative scenario of size determination, where disk size is determined relative to the fixed morphogen distribution by a certain threshold level of morphogen required for growth. We propose that when disk boundary reaches the threshold the arrest of cell proliferation throughout the disk is induced by mechanical stress in the tissue. Mechanical stress is expected to arise from the nonuniformity of morphogen distribution that drives growth. This stress, through a negative feedback on growth, can compensate for the nonuniformity of morphogen, achieving uniform growth with the rate that vanishes when disk boundary reaches the threshold. The mechanism is demonstrated through computer simulations of a tissue growth model that identifies the key assumptions and testable predictions. This analysis provides an alternative hypothesis for the size determination process. Novel experimental approaches will be needed to test this model. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.},

abstract = {The plant hormone auxin has crucial roles in almost all aspects of plant growth and development. Concentrations of auxin vary across different tissues, mediating distinct developmental outcomes and contributing to the functional diversity of auxin. However, the mechanisms that underlie these activities are poorly understood. Here we identify an auxin signalling mechanism, which acts in parallel to the canonical auxin pathway based on the transport inhibitor response1 (TIR1) and other auxin receptor F-box (AFB) family proteins (TIR1/AFB receptors)1,2, that translates levels of cellular auxin to mediate differential growth during apical-hook development. This signalling mechanism operates at the concave side of the apical hook, and involves auxin-mediated C-terminal cleavage of transmembrane kinase 1 (TMK1). The cytosolic and nucleus-translocated C terminus of TMK1 specifically interacts with and phosphorylates two non-canonical transcriptional repressors of the auxin or indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) family (IAA32 and IAA34), thereby regulating ARF transcription factors. In contrast to the degradation of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors in the canonical pathway, the newly identified mechanism stabilizes the non-canonical IAA32 and IAA34 transcriptional repressors to regulate gene expression and ultimately inhibit growth. The auxin–TMK1 signalling pathway originates at the cell surface, is triggered by high levels of auxin and shares a partially overlapping set of transcription factors with the TIR1/AFB signalling pathway. This allows distinct interpretations of different concentrations of cellular auxin, and thus enables this versatile signalling molecule to mediate complex developmental outcomes.},

abstract = {The division of eukaryotic cells involves the assembly of complex cytoskeletal structures to exert the forces required for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. In plants, empirical evidence suggests that tensional forces within the cytoskeleton cause cells to divide along the plane that minimizes the surface area of the cell plate (Errera's rule) while creating daughter cells of equal size. However, exceptions to Errera's rule cast doubt on whether a broadly applicable rule can be formulated for plant cell division. Here, we show that the selection of the plane of division involves a competition between alternative configurations whose geometries represent local area minima. We find that the probability of observing a particular division configuration increases inversely with its relative area according to an exponential probability distribution known as the Gibbs measure. Moreover, a comparison across land plants and their most recent algal ancestors confirms that the probability distribution is widely conserved and independent of cell shape and size. Using a maximum entropy formulation, we show that this empirical division rule is predicted by the dynamics of the tense cytoskeletal elements that lead to the positioning of the preprophase band. Based on the fact that the division plane is selected from the sole interaction of the cytoskeleton with cell shape, we posit that the new rule represents the default mechanism for plant cell division when internal or external cues are absent.},

A direct peptide-receptor interaction is supported by specific binding of RALF to FERONIA and reduced binding and insensitivity to RALF-induced growth inhibition in feronia mutants. Phosphoproteome measurements demonstrate that the RALF-FERONIA interaction causes phosphorylation of plasma membrane H+-adenosine triphosphatase 2 at Ser899, mediating the inhibition of proton transport. The results reveal a molecular mechanism for RALF-induced extracellular alkalinization and a signaling pathway that regulates cell expansion.},

In plants, tip-growing cells require actin for cell expansion and microtubules for orientation of cell expansion, but how the two cytoskeletons are linked is an open question. In tip-growing cells of the moss Physcomitrella patens , we show that an actin cluster near the cell apex dictates the direction of rapid cell expansion. Formation of this structure depends on the convergence of microtubules near the cell tip. We discovered that microtubule convergence requires class VIII myosin function, and actin is necessary for myosin VIII–mediated focusing of microtubules. The loss of myosin VIII function affects both networks, indicating functional connections among the three cytoskeletal components. Our data suggest that microtubules direct localization of formins, actin nucleation factors, that generate actin filaments further focusing microtubules, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop ensuring that actin polymerization and cell expansion occur at a defined site resulting in persistent polarized growth. },

These actions require non-transcriptional responses such as changes in the cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking, which are commonly regulated by ROP/Rac GTPase-dependent pathways. These findings beg for the question about the nature of auxin receptors that regulate these responses and renew the interest in ABP1 as a cell surface auxin receptor, including the work showing auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) interacts with the extracellular domain of the transmembrane kinase (TMK) receptor-like kinases in an auxin-dependent manner, as well as the debate on this auxin binding protein discovered about 40 years ago.

However, analysis of early embryo development and tissue morphogenesis has highlighted the role of the spatial distribution of cortical cues able to guide spindle orientation. In vitro studies of cell division have revealed similar mechanisms. Recent data support the possibility that the orientation of cell division in mammalian cells is dominated by cell adhesion and the associated traction forces developed in interphase. Cell shape is a manifestation of these adhesive and tensional patterns. These patterns control the spatial distribution of cortical signals and thereby guide spindle orientation and daughter cell positioning. From these data, cell division appears to be a continuous transformation ensuring the maintenance of tissue mechanical integrity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Polyhedral plant cells can display complex patterning in which individual faces are established as biochemically distinct domains by endomembrane trafficking. We now show that, during organogenesis, the Arabidopsis endomembrane system specifies an important additional cellular spatial domain: the geometric edges. Previously unidentified membrane vesicles lying immediately beneath the plasma membrane at cell edges were revealed through localization of RAB-A5c, a plant GTPase of the Rab family of membrane-trafficking regulators. Specific inhibition of RAB-A5c activity grossly perturbed cell geometry in developing lateral organs by interfering independently with growth anisotropy and cytokinesis without disrupting default membrane trafficking. The initial loss of normal cell geometry can be explained by a failure to maintain wall stiffness specifically at geometric edges. RAB-A5c thus meets a requirement to specify this cellular spatial domain during organogenesis.},

We study this problem in two related plants with differently shaped leaves: Arabidopsis thaliana (simple leaf shape) and Cardamine hirsuta (complex shape with leaflets). We use live imaging, modeling, and genetics to deconstruct these organ-level differences into their cell-level constituents: growth amount, direction, and differentiation. We show that leaf shape depends on the interplay of two growth modes: a conserved organ-wide growth mode that reflects differentiation; and a local, directional mode that involves the patterning of growth foci along the leaf edge. Shape diversity results from the distinct effects of two homeobox genes on these growth modes: SHOOTMERISTEMLESS broadens organ-wide growth relative to edge-patterning, enabling leaflet emergence, while REDUCED COMPLEXITY inhibits growth locally around emerging leaflets, accentuating shape differences created by patterning. We demonstrate the predictivity of our findings by reconstructing key features of C. hirsuta leaf morphology in A. thaliana. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

abstract = {Long-standing models propose that plant growth responses to light or gravity are mediated by asymmetric distribution of the phytohormone auxin. Physiological studies implicated a specific transport system that relocates auxin laterally, thereby effecting differential growth; however, neither the molecular components of this system nor the cellular mechanism of auxin redistribution on light or gravity perception have been identified. Here, we show that auxin accumulates asymmetrically during differential growth in an efflux-dependent manner. Mutations in the Arabidopsis gene PIN3, a regulator of auxin efflux, alter differential growth. PIN3 is expressed in gravity-sensing tissues, with PIN3 protein accumulating predominantly at the lateral cell surface. PIN3 localizes to the plasma membrane and to vesicles that cycle in an actin-dependent manner. In the root columella, PIN3 is positioned symmetrically at the plasma membrane but rapidly relocalizes laterally on gravity stimulation. Our data indicate that PIN3 is a component of the lateral auxin transport system regulating tropic growth. In addition, actin-dependent relocalization of PIN3 in response to gravity provides a mechanism for redirecting auxin flux to trigger asymmetric growth.},

Recent studies revealed that distinct spatial signals including ROP GTPase, cellular geometry, and mechanical stress regulate the behavior of cortical microtubules at the subcellular and supercellular levels, giving rise to dramatic rearrangements in the cortical microtubule array in response to internal and external cues. Increasing evidence indicates that negative regulators of microtubules also contribute to the rearrangement of the cortical microtubule array.

Here we present our unexpected findings that ABP1 is neither required for auxin signaling nor necessary for plant development under normal growth conditions. We used our ribozyme-based CRISPR technology to generate an Arabidopsis abp1 mutant that contains a 5-bp deletion in the first exon of ABP1, which resulted in a frameshift and introduction of early stop codons. We also identified a T-DNA insertion abp1 allele that harbors a T-DNA insertion located 27 bp downstream of the ATG start codon in the first exon. We show that the two new abp1 mutants are null alleles. Surprisingly, our new abp1 mutant plants do not display any obvious developmental defects. In fact, the mutant plants are indistinguishable from wild-type plants at every developmental stage analyzed. Furthermore, the abp1 plants are not resistant to exogenous auxin. At the molecular level, we find that the induction of known auxin-regulated genes is similar in both wild-type and abp1 plants in response to auxin treatments. We conclude that ABP1 is not a key component in auxin signaling or Arabidopsis development.},

With its morphogen-like properties, auxin controls sites and timing of differentiation and/or growth responses both, in quantitative and qualitative terms. Specificity in the auxin response depends largely on distinct modes of signal transmission, by which individual cells perceive and convert auxin signals into a remarkable diversity of responses. The best understood, or so-called canonical mechanism of auxin perception ultimately results in variable adjustments of the cellular transcriptome, via a short, nuclear signal transduction pathway. Additional findings that accumulated over decades implied that an additional, presumably, cell surface-based auxin perception mechanism mediates very rapid cellular responses and decisively contributes to the cell's overall hormonal response. Recent investigations into both, nuclear and cell surface auxin signalling challenged this assumed partition of roles for different auxin signalling pathways and revealed an unexpected complexity in transcriptional and non-transcriptional cellular responses mediated by auxin.},

abstract = {Precise knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of cell division, including number and orientation of divisions, and knowledge of cell expansion, is central to understanding morphogenesis. Our current knowledge of cell division patterns during plant and animal morphogenesis is largely deduced from analysis of clonal shapes and sizes. But such an analysis can reveal only the number, not the orientation or exact rate, of cell divisions. In this study, we have analyzed growth in real time by monitoring individual cell divisions in the shoot apical meristems (SAMs) of Arabidopsis thaliana. The live imaging technique has led to the development of a spatial and temporal map of cell division patterns. We have integrated cell behavior over time to visualize growth. Our analysis reveals temporal variation in mitotic activity and the cell division is coordinated across clonally distinct layers of cells. Temporal variation in mitotic activity is not correlated to the estimated plastochron length and diurnal rhythms. Cell division rates vary across the SAM surface. Cells in the peripheral zone (PZ) divide at a faster rate than in the central zone (CZ). Cell division rates in the CZ are relatively heterogeneous when compared with PZ cells. We have analyzed the cell behavior associated with flower primordium development starting from a stage at which the future flower comprises four cells in the L1 epidermal layer. Primordium development is a sequential process linked to distinct cellular behavior. Oriented cell divisions, in primordial progenitors and in cells located proximal to them, are associated with initial primordial outgrowth. The oriented cell divisions are followed by a rapid burst of cell expansion and cell division, which transforms a flower primordium into a three-dimensional flower bud. Distinct lack of cell expansion is seen in a narrow band of cells, which forms the boundary region between developing flower bud and the SAM. We discuss these results in the context of SAM morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the origin and evolution of land plants and their algal relatives is a fundamental problem in plant phylogenetics, and is essential for understanding how critical adaptations arose, including the embryo, vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. Despite advances in molecular systematics, some hypotheses of relationships remain weakly resolved. Inferring deep phylogenies with bouts of rapid diversification can be problematic; however, genome-scale data should significantly increase the number of informative characters for analyses. Recent phylogenomic reconstructions focused on the major divergences of plants have resulted in promising but inconsistent results. One limitation is sparse taxon sampling, likely resulting from the difficulty and cost of data generation. To address this limitation, transcriptome data for 92 streptophyte taxa were generated and analyzed along with 11 published plant genome sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted using up to 852 nuclear genes and 1,701,170 aligned sites. Sixty-nine analyses were performed to test the robustness of phylogenetic inferences to permutations of the data matrix or to phylogenetic method, including supermatrix, supertree, and coalescent-based approaches, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, partitioned and unpartitioned analyses, and amino acid versus DNA alignments. Among other results, we find robust support for a sister-group relationship between land plants and one group of streptophyte green algae, the Zygnematophyceae. Strong and robust support for a clade comprising liverworts and mosses is inconsistent with a widely accepted view of early land plant evolution, and suggests that phylogenetic hypotheses used to understand the evolution of fundamental plant traits should be reevaluated.},

abstract = {A striking phenomenon unique to the kingdom of plants is the regular arrangement of lateral organs around a central axis, known as phyllotaxis. Recent molecular-genetic experiments indicate that active transport of the plant hormone auxin is the key process regulating phyllotaxis. A conceptual model based on these experiments, introduced by Reinhardt et al. [Reinhardt, D., Pesce, E. R., Stieger, P., Mandel, T., Baltensperger, K., et al. (2003) Nature 426, 255-260], provides an intuitively plausible interpretation of the data, but raises questions of whether the proposed mechanism is, in fact, capable of producing the observed temporal and spatial patterns, is robust, can start de novo, and can account for phyllotactic transitions, such as the frequently observed transition from decussate to spiral phyllotaxis. To answer these questions, we created a computer simulation model based on data described previously or in this paper and reasonable hypotheses. The model reproduces, within the standard error, the divergence angles measured in Arabidopsis seedlings and the effects of selected experimental manipulations. It also reproduces distichous, decussate, and tricussate patterns. The model thus offers a plausible link between molecular mechanisms of morphogenesis and the geometry of phyllotaxis. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

It has been firmly established that canonical, nuclear auxin signalling acts through regulation of gene transcription2. Here, we combined microfluidics, live imaging, genetic engineering and computational modelling to reanalyse the classical case of root growth inhibition3 by auxin. We show that Arabidopsis roots react to addition and removal of auxin by extremely rapid adaptation of growth rate. This process requires intracellular auxin perception but not transcriptional reprogramming. The formation of the canonical TIR1/AFB–Aux/IAA co-receptor complex is required for the growth regulation, hinting to a novel, non-transcriptional branch of this signalling pathway. Our results challenge the current understanding of root growth regulation by auxin and suggest another, presumably non-transcriptional, signalling output of the canonical auxin pathway.},

Here we describe a new method, ergodic rate analysis (ERA), that uses single-cell measurements of fixed steady-state populations to accurately infer the rates of molecular events, including rates of cell growth. ERA exploits the fact that the number of cells in a particular state is related to the average transit time through that state. With this method, it is possible to calculate full time trajectories of any feature that can be labelled in fixed cells, for example levels of phosphoproteins or total cellular mass. Using ERA we find evidence for a size-discriminatory process at the G1/S transition that acts to decrease cell-to-cell size variation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Endodermal cells overlying lateral root primordia lose volume, change shape, and relinquish their tight junction-like diffusion barrier to make way for the emerging lateral root primordium. Endodermal feedback is absolutely required for initiation and growth of lateral roots, and we provide evidence that this is mediated by controlled volume loss in the endodermis.

abstract = {The phytohormone auxin is a major regulator of diverse aspects of plant growth and development. The ubiquitin-ligase complex SCFTIR1/AFB (for Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein), which includes the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB) auxin receptor family, has recently been demonstrated to be critical for auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation. Early-phase auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation, on the other hand, has long been explained by the acid-growth theory, for which proton extrusion by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase is a functional prerequisite. However, the mechanism by which auxin mediates H+-ATPase activation has yet to be elucidated. Here, we present direct evidence for H+- ATPase activation in etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by auxin through phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine during early-phase hypocotyl elongation. Application of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to endogenous auxin-depleted hypocotyl sections induced phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine of the H+-ATPase and increased H+-ATPase activity without altering the amount of the enzyme. Changes in both the phosphorylation level of H+- ATPase and IAA-induced elongation were similarly concentration dependent. Furthermore, IAA-induced H+-ATPase phosphorylation occurred in a tir1-1 afb2-3 double mutant, which is severely defective in auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation. In addition, $\alpha$-(phenylethyl-2-one)-IAA, the auxin antagonist specific for the nuclear auxin receptor TIR1/AFBs, had no effect on IAA-induced H+-ATPase phosphorylation. These results suggest that the TIR1/AFB auxin receptor family is not involved in auxin-induced H+-ATPase phosphorylation. Our results define the activation mechanism of H+-ATPase by auxin during early-phase hypocotyl elongation; this is the long-sought-after mechanism that is central to the acid-growth theory. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract = {A developing plant organ exhibits complex spatiotemporal patterns of growth, cell division, cell size, cell shape, and organ shape. Explaining these patterns presents a challenge because of their dynamics and cross-correlations, which can make it difficult to disentangle causes from effects. To address these problems, we used live imaging to determine the spatiotemporal patterns of leaf growth and division in different genetic and tissue contexts. In the simplifying background of the speechless (spch) mutant, which lacks stomatal lineages, the epidermal cell layer exhibits defined patterns of division, cell size, cell shape, and growth along the proximodistal and mediolateral axes. The patterns and correlations are distinctive from those observed in the connected subepidermal layer and also different from the epidermal layer of wild type. Through computational modelling we show that the results can be accounted for by a dual control model in which spatiotemporal control operates on both growth and cell division, with cross-connections between them. The interactions between resulting growth and division patterns lead to a dynamic distributions of cell sizes and shapes within a deforming leaf. By modulating parameters of the model, we illustrate how phenotypes with correlated changes in cell size, cell number, and organ size may be generated. The model thus provides an integrated view of growth and division that can act as a framework for further experimental study.},

abstract = {Auxin is a crucial growth regulator in plants. However, a comprehensive understanding of how auxin induces cell expansion is perplexing, because auxin acts in a concentration- and cell type-dependent manner. Consequently, it is desirable to focus on certain cell types to exemplify the underlying growth mechanisms. On the other hand, plant tissues display supracellular growth (beyond the level of single cells); hence, other cell types might compromise the growth of a certain tissue. Tip-growing cells do not display neighbor-induced growth constraints and, therefore, are a valuable source of information for growth-controlling mechanisms. Here, we focus on auxin-induced cellular elongation in root hairs, exposing a mechanistic view of plant growth regulation. We highlight a complex interplay between auxin metabolism and transport, steering root hair development in response to internal and external triggers. Auxin signaling modules and downstream cascades of transcription factors define a developmental program that appears rate limiting for cellular growth. With this knowledge in mind, the root hair cell is a very suitable model system in which to dissect cellular effectors required for cellular expansion.},

abstract = {Cytokinins are mobile multifunctional plant hormones with roles in development and stress resilience [1][1],[2][2]. Although cytokinin receptors are substantially localised to the endoplasmic reticulum [3][3]–[5][4], the cellular sites of cytokinin perception continue to be debated [1][1],[6][5],[7][6]. Several cytokinin types display bioactivity [8][7],[9][8] and recently a cell-specific cytokinin gradient was reported in roots [10][9]. Yet, the importance of spatially heterogeneous cytokinin distribution and the specific cytokinin(s) that account for the different responses remain unclear. Here we show that cytokinin perception by plasma membrane receptors is an effective path for cytokinin response in root cells. Readout from a Two Component Signalling cytokinin-specific reporter ( TCSn::GFP; [11][10]) is closely matched to intracellular cytokinin content, yet a proportion of bioactive cytokinins are detected in the extracellular fluid. Using cytokinins covalently linked to beads that could not pass the plasma membrane, we demonstrate that strong TCSn activation still occurs and that this response is greatly diminished in cytokinin receptor mutants. Although intracellular receptors play significant roles, we argue for a revision of concepts of cytokinin perception to include the spatial dimensions. In particular, selective ligand-receptor affinities, cellular localisation and tissue distribution of bioactive cytokinins, their receptors, transporters and inactivation enzymes appear all to be components of the signalling regulatory mechanisms.

abstract = {The monoclonal antibody MAC 256 precipitates specifically the auxin-binding protein (ABP) of maize membranes. Auxin-binding activity was recovered from the immunoprecipitate and MAC 256 can, therefore, bind undenatured, native ABP. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to present native ABP to MAC 256 and under these conditions auxins inhibit antibody binding. Millimolar naphthalene-1-acetic acid completely blocks MAC 256 binding and the characteristics of monoclonal antibody MAC 259 are similar. The ability of a range of auxins and related compounds to displace MAC 256 correlates with the known structure-activity relationships of these compounds in vivo and in binding assays. The results are interpreted in terms of an auxin-induced conformational change in ABP, auxin binding leading to a change in, or concealment of, the epitope of the antibody. The epitope for MAC 256 and 259 lies close to the carboxy terminus of the protein, implying that the part of ABP containing the sequence of amino acids responsible for retention within the endoplasmic reticulum is conformationally active. {\textcopyright} 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

For example, an active calcium influx channel localized at the tip of Arabidopsis root hairs has been identified by patch-clamp measurements. Actin has been visualized in vivo in Arabidopsis root hairs by using a green-fluorescent-protein-talin reporter and shown to form a dense mesh in the apex of the growing tip. The kojak gene, which encodes a protein similar to the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase, is needed in the first stages of hair growth. A role for LRX1, a leucine-rich repeat extensin, in determining the morphology of the cell wall of root hairs has been established using reverse genetics. The new information can be integrated into a general and more advanced view of how these specialized plant cells grow.},

abstract = {Cortical microtubules in the epidermis of regenerating Graptopetalum plants were examined by in situ immunofluorescence. Paradermal slices of tissue were prepared by a method that preserves microtubule arrays and also maintains cell junctions. To test the hypothesis that cortical microtubule arrays align perpendicular to the direction of organ growth, arrays were visualized and their orientation quantified. A majority of microtubules are in transverse orientation with respect to the organ axis early in shoot development when the growth habit is uniform. Later in development, when growth habit is non-uniform and the tissue is contoured, cortical microtubules are increasingly longitudinal and oblique in orientation. Microtubules show only a minor change in orientation at the site of greatest curvature, the transition zone of a developing leaf. To assess the role of the division plane on orientation of arrays, the pattern of microtubules was examined in individual cells of common shape. Cells derived from transverse divisions have predominately transverse cortical arrays, whereas cells derived from oblique and longitudinal divisions have non-transverse arrays. The results show that, regardless of the stage of development, microtubules orient with respect to cell shape and plane of division. The results suggest that cytoskeletal function is best considered in small domains of growth within an organ. {\textcopyright} 1989 Springer-Verlag.},

Cell shape is the product of a cell's material and active properties balanced by external forces. Control of cell shape, therefore, relies on both tight regulation of intracellular mechanics and the cell's physical interaction with its environment. In this review, we first discuss the biological and physical mechanisms of cell shape control. We next examine a number of developmental processes in which cell shape change - either individually or in a coordinated manner - drives embryonic morphogenesis and discuss how cell shape is controlled in these processes. Finally, we emphasize that cell shape control during tissue morphogenesis can only be fully understood by using a combination of cellular, molecular, developmental and biophysical approaches. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The mechanisms through which plant cells control growth and shape are the result of the coordinated action of many events, notably cell wall stress relaxation and turgor-driven expansion. The scalar nature of turgor pressure would drive plant cells to assume spherical shapes; however, this is not the case, as plant cells show an amazing variety of morphologies. Plant cell walls are dynamic structures that can display alterations in matrix polysaccharide composition and concentration, which ultimately affect the wall deformation rate. The wide varieties of plant cell shapes, spanning from elongated cylinders (as pollen tubes) and jigsaw puzzle-like epidermal cells, to very long fibres and branched stellate leaf trichomes, can be understood if the underlying mechanisms regulating wall biosynthesis and cytoskeletal dynamics are addressed. This review aims at gathering the available knowledge on the fundamental mechanisms regulating expansion, growth and shape in plant cells by putting a special emphasis on the cell wall-cytoskeleton system continuum. In particular, we discuss from a molecular point of view the growth mechanisms characterizing cell types with strikingly different geometries and describe their relationship with primary walls. The purpose, here, is to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of the multitude of events through which plant cells manage to expand and control their final shapes. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Here, we show that MIKCC-type MADS-box genes in the moss Physcomitrella patens function in two ways to enable fertilization. Analyses of protein localization, deletion mutants and overexpression lines of all six genes indicate that three MIKCC-type MADS-box genes redundantly regulate cell division and growth in the stems for appropriate external water conduction, as well as the formation of sperm with motile flagella. The former function appears to be maintained in the flowering plant lineage, while the latter was lost in accordance with the loss of sperm.},

abstract = {The plant actin cytoskeleton is an unstable network of filaments that influences polarized growth through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we used a combination of live cell imaging and finite element computational modelling of Arabidopsis trichome morphogenesis to determine how the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons cooperate to pattern the cell wall and growth. The actin-related protein (ARP)2/3 complex generates an actin meshwork that operates within a tip-localized, microtubule-depleted zone to modulate cell wall anisotropy locally. The actin meshwork also positions an actin bundle network that organizes organelle flow patterns. This activity is required to maintain cell wall thickness gradients that enable tip-biased diffuse growth. These newly discovered couplings between cytoskeletal patterns and wall textures provide important insights into the cellular mechanism of growth control in plants. T he microtubule and actin cytoskeletons cooperate to influence shape change in both metazoan 1 and plant 2 cells. In plants, these cytoskeletal systems locally modulate the mechanical properties of the cell wall 3,4 , and in the epidermis, heterogeneities in wall texture guide the complex patterns of irreversible cell expansion 5. In leaves, these growth patterns are important because they can persist for days 6,7 and influence organ size and shape 8. Microtubule-dependent cellulose microfibril patterning is one central feature of polarized diffuse growth 9,10 ; however, the means by which the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons cooperate during cell morphogenesis is poorly understood. Leaf trichomes, specialized leaf epidermal cells that protect the growing organ against insect attack 11 , like single-celled cotton fibres 12 , are model cell types that can be used to analyse how the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons control polarized growth 13,14. The distorted Arabidopsis leaf trichome mutants identified an evolu-tionarily conserved actin filament nucleation pathway, in which the WAVE/SCAR regulatory complex (W/SRC) 15 positively regulates the actin filament nucleator ARP2/3 16-18. Although it is known that W/SRC-ARP2/3 is required to maintain organized actin bundle networks and polarized cell elongation 13,17,19-21 , the mechanisms by which it influences the cell wall properties that determine the growth behaviours of the cell are not known. Here we integrate live cell imaging and computational analyses of the cell wall to determine how an ARP2/3-generated apical actin meshwork influences cell wall properties that define the geometry of shape change. Creation of a plausible finite element model Branch elongation and tip refinement are defining features of trichome morphogenesis 13 , but at present there are no clear hypotheses about what combinations of cell wall mechanical properties would be needed to generate this type of shape change. Finite element computational modelling is a useful framework to simulate the complex relationships between turgor pressure, cell wall mechanical properties and growth 4. To parameterize a finite element model of the cell wall and branch elongation, we conducted a series of reflected light time-lapse imaging experiments (Supplementary},

@article{Meyers2006,
abstract = {Background: In order for signals generated at the plasma membrane to reach intracellular targets, activated messengers, such as G proteins and phosphoproteins, must diffuse through the cytoplasm. If the deactivators of these messengers, GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and phosphatases, respectively, are sufficiently active in the cytoplasm, then the signal could in principle decay before reaching the target and a stable spatial gradient in phosphostate would be generated. Recent experiments document the existence of such gradients in living cells and suggest a role for them in mitotic spindle morphogenesis and cell migration. However, how such systems behave theoretically when embedded in a cell of varying size or shape has not been considered. Results: Here we use a simple mathematical model to explore the theoretical consequences of a plasma membrane bound activator (i.e., guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GEF, or kinase) and a cytoplasmic deactivator (i.e., GAP or phosphatase), and we find that as a model cell grows, the substrate becomes progressively dephosphorylated as a result of decreased proximity to the activator. Conversely, as a cell spreads and flattens, the substrate becomes globally phosphorylated because of increased proximity of the substrate to the activator. Similarly, in the leading edge of polarized cells and in protrusions such as lamellipodia or filopodia, the substrate is highly phosphorylated. As a specific test of the model, we found that the experimentally observed preferential activation of the G protein Cdc42 in the periphery of fibroblasts that was recently reported is consistent with model predictions. Conclusions: We conclude that cell-signaling pathways can theoretically be turned on and off, both locally and globally, in response to alterations in cell size and shape. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The plant hormone auxin promotes cell expansion. Forty years ago, the acid growth theory was proposed, whereby auxin promotes proton efflux to acidify the apoplast and facilitate the uptake of solutes and water to drive plant cell expansion. However, the underlying molecular and genetic bases of this process remain unclear. We have previously shown that the SAUR19-24 subfamily of auxin-induced SMALL AUXIN UP-RNA (SAUR) genes promotes cell expansion. Here, we demonstrate that SAUR proteins provide a mechanistic link between auxin and plasma membrane H+-ATPases (PM H+-ATPases) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants overexpressing stabilized SAUR19 fusion proteins exhibit increased PM H+-ATPase activity, and the increased growth phenotypes conferred by SAUR19 overexpression are dependent upon normal PM H+-ATPase function. We find that SAUR19 stimulates PM H+-ATPase activity by promoting phosphorylation of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain. Additionally, we identify a regulatory mechanism by which SAUR19 modulates PM H+-ATPase phosphorylation status. SAUR19 as well as additional SAUR proteins interact with the PP2C-D subfamily of type 2C protein phosphatases. We demonstrate that these phosphatases are inhibited upon SAUR binding, act antagonistically to SAURs in vivo, can physically interact with PM H+-ATPases, and negatively regulate PM H+-ATPase activity. Our findings provide a molecular framework for elucidating auxin-mediated control of plant cell expansion. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.},

Our focus is on the presumptive mesodermal and neural tissues of the Xenopus (frog) embryo, tissues for which some physical measurements have been made.

abstract = {Morphogenesis occurs in 3D space over time and is guided by coordinated gene expression programs. Here we use postembryonic development in Arabidopsis plants to investigate the genetic control of growth. We demonstrate that gene expression driving the production of the growth-stimulating hormone gibberellic acid and downstream growth factors is first induced within the radicle tip of the embryo. The center of cell expansion is, however, spatially displaced from the center of gene expression. Because the rapidly growing cells have very different geometry from that of those at the tip, we hypothesized that mechanical factors may contribute to this growth displacement. To this end we developed 3D finite-element method models of growing custom-designed digital embryos at cellular resolution. We used this framework to conceptualize how cell size, shape, and topology influence tissue growth and to explore the interplay of geometrical and genetic inputs into growth distribution. Our simulations showed that mechanical constraints are sufficient to explain the disconnect between the experimentally observed spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and early post-embryonic growth. The center of cell expansion is the position where genetic and mechanical facilitators of growth converge. We have thus uncovered a mechanism whereby 3D cellular geometry helps direct where genetically specified growth takes place.},

abstract = {The vesicle trafficking inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) changes the localization of plasma membrane localized PINs, proteins that function as polar auxin efflux carriers, by inducing their accumulation within cells. Pretreatment with the synthetic auxin 1-NAA reduces this BFA-induced PIN internalization, suggesting that auxinic compounds inhibit the endocytosis of PIN proteins. However, the most important natural auxin, IAA, did not substantially inhibit PIN internalization unless a supplementary antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), was also included in the incubation medium. We asked whether the relatively small inhibition caused by IAA alone could be explained by its instability in the incubation solution or whether IAA might interact with BHT to inhibit endocytosis. Analysis of the IAA concentration in the incubation solution and of DR5 reporter activity in the roots showed that IAA is both stable and active in the medium. Therefore, IAA degradation was not able to explain the inability of IAA to inhibit endocytosis. Furthermore, when applied in the absence of auxin, BHT caused a strong increase in the rate of PIN1 internalization and a weaker increase in the rate of PIN2 internalization. These increases were unaffected by the simultaneous application of IAA, further indicating that endocytosis is not inhibited by the natural auxin IAA under physiologically relevant conditions. Endocytosis was inhibited at the same rate with 2-NAA, an inactive auxin analog, as was observed with 1-NAA and more strongly than with natural auxins, supporting the idea that this inhibition is not auxin specific.},

abstract = {It has long been hypothesized that cortical microtubules (MTs) control the orientation of cellulose microfibril deposition, but no mutants with alterations of MT orientation have been shown to affect this process. We have shown previously that in Arabidopsis, the fra2 mutation causes aberrant cortical MT orientation and reduced cell elongation, and the gene responsible for the fra2 mutation encodes a katanin-like protein. In this study, using field emission scanning electron microscopy, we found that the fra2 mutation altered the normal orientation of cellulose microfibrils in walls of expanding cells. Although cellulose microfibrils in walls of wild-type cells were oriented transversely along the elongation axis, cellulose microfibrils in walls of fra2 cells often formed bands and ran in different directions. The fra2 mutation also caused aberrant deposition of cellulose microfibrils in secondary walls of fiber cells. The aberrant orientation of cellulose microfibrils was shown to be correlated with disorganized cortical MTs in several cell types examined. In addition, the thickness of both primary and secondary cell walls was reduced significantly in the fra2 mutant. These results indicate that the katanin-like protein is essential for oriented cellulose microfibril deposition and normal cell wall biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that the Arabidopsis katanin-like protein possessed MT-severing activity in vitro; thus, it is an ortholog of animal katanin. We propose that the aberrant MT orientation caused by the mutation of katanin results in the distorted deposition of cellulose microfibrils, which in turn leads to a defect in cell elongation. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that cortical MTs regulate the oriented deposition of cellulose microfibrils that determines the direction of cell elongation.},

abstract = {Plant cells are embedded within cell walls, which provide structural integrity, but also spatially constrain cells, and must therefore be modified to allow cellular expansion. The long-standing acid growth theory postulates that auxin triggers apoplast acidification, thereby activating cell wall-loosening enzymes that enable cell expansion in shoots. Interestingly, this model remains heavily debated in roots, because of both the complex role of auxin in plant development as well as technical limitations in investigating apoplastic pH at cellular resolution. Here, we introduce 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) as a suitable fluorescent pH indicator for assessing apoplastic pH, and thus acid growth, at a cellular resolution in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Using HPTS, we demonstrate that cell wall acidification triggers cellular expansion,which is correlated with a preceding increase of auxin signaling. Reduction in auxin levels, perception, or signaling abolishes both the extracellular acidification and cellular expansion. These findings jointly suggest that endogenous auxin controls apoplastic acidification and the onset of cellular elongation in roots. In contrast, an endogenous or exogenous increase in auxin levels induces a transient alkalinization of the extracellular matrix, reducing cellular elongation. The receptor-like kinase FERONIA is required for this physiological process, which affects cellular root expansion during the gravitropic response. These findings pinpoint a complex, presumably concentrationdependent role for auxin in apoplastic pH regulation, steering the rate of root cell expansion and gravitropic response.},

abstract = {Cell polarity is the ultimate reflection of complex mecha- nisms that establish and maintain functionally special- ized domains in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The spatial arrangement and protein composition of these domains facilitate cellular processes as diverse as differentiation, localized membrane growth, activa- tion of the immune response, directional cell migration, and vectorial transport of molecules across cell layers. In this review, two phylogenetically distant eukaryotic cells, budding yeast and mammalian epithelial cells, are examined to highlight advances in our understanding of how cell polarity is established. Both of these cells are characterizedby a highdegree of cellular asymmetry (see Figure 1) and have been used extensively to study how cell polarity is developed. The specific focus here is on the molecular nature of the intrinsic and extrinsic spatial cues that establish structural and molecular asymmetry at the cell surface, the mechanisms that in- terpret signals from these cues to generate new mem- brane domains, andthe reorganization of thecell around these spatially defined sites (see Figure 2). Theevidence supports a model in which a hierarchy of three sequen- tial stages is required to establish cell polarity from a spatial cue (see Figure 3). This hierarchy consists of the following: marking a site and decoding the cue; reinforc- ing the cue; propagating the cue. Feedback regulation at each stage coordinates and reinforces the proper ordering of these events, resulting in the maintenance of cell polarity. Eachlevel of this hierarchy is colorcoded and epithelial cells. Because these two cell types are separated by a large phylogenetic distance, the similar- ity of stages suggests that mechanisms used for impos- ing cell polarity might be quite general.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis in plants arises from the interplay of genetic and physical interactions within a growing network of cells. The physical aspects of cell proliferation and differentiation are genetically regulated, but constrained by mechanical interactions between the cells. Higher plant tissues consist of an elaborate three-dimensional matrix of active cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, where it is difficult to obtain direct measurements of geometry or cell interactions. To properly understand the workings of plant morphogenesis, it is necessary to have biological systems that allow simple and direct observation of these processes. We have adopted a highly simplified plant system to investigate how cell proliferation and expansion is coordinated during morphogenesis. Coleocheate scutata is a microscopic fresh-water green alga with simple anatomical features that allow for accurate quantification of morphogenetic processes. Image analysis techniques were used to extract precise models for cell geometry and physical parameters for growth. This allowed construction of a deformable finite element model for growth of the whole organism, which incorporated cell biophysical properties, viscous expansion of cell walls, and rules for regulation of cell behavior. The study showed that a simple set of autonomous, cell-based rules are sufficient to account for the morphological and dynamic properties of Coleochaete growth. A variety of morphogenetic behavior emerged from the application of these local rules. Cell shape sensing is sufficient to explain the patterns of cell division during growth. This simplifying principle is likely to have application in modeling and design for engineering of higher plant tissues.},

abstract = {Auxin functions as a key morphogen in regulating plant growth and development. Studies on auxin-regulated gene expression and on the mechanism of polar auxin transport and its asymmetric distribution within tissues have provided the basis for realizing the molecular mechanisms underlying auxin function. In eukaryotes, members of the Ras and Rho subfamilies of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases function as molecular switches in many signaling cascades that regulate growth and development. Plants do not have Ras proteins, but they contain Rho-like small G proteins called RACs or ROPs that, like fungal and metazoan Rhos, are regulators of cell polarity and may also undertake some Ras functions. Here, we discuss the advances made over the last decade that implicate RAC/ROPs as mediators for auxin-regulated gene expression, rapid cell surface-located auxin signaling, and directional auxin transport. We also describe experimental data indicating that auxin-RAC/ROP crosstalk may form regulatory feedback loops and theoretical modeling that attempts to connect local auxin gradients with RAC/ROP regulation of cell polarity. We hope that by discussing these experimental and modeling studies, this perspective will stimulate efforts to further refine our understanding of auxin signaling via the RAC/ ROP molecular switch. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

However, it has remained unclear how auxin can simultaneously regulate patterning and organ outgrowth and how its distribution is stabilized in a primordium-specif ic manner. Here we show that five PIN genes collectively control auxin distribution to regulate cell division and cell expansion in the primary root. Furthermore, the joint action of these genes has an important role in pattern formation by focusing the auxin maximum and restricting the expression domain of PLETHORA (PLT) genes, major determinants for root stem cell specification. In turn, PLT genes are required for PIN gene transcription to stabilize the auxin maximum at the distal root tip. Our data reveal an interaction network of auxin transport facilitators and root fate determinants that control patterning and growth of the root primordium.},

abstract = {Background and AimsThe hormone auxin and reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate root elongation, but the interactions between the two pathways are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate how auxin interacts with ROS in regulating root elongation in tomato, Solanum lycopersicum. MethodsWild-type and auxin-resistant mutant, diageotropica (dgt), of tomato (S. lycopersicum 'Ailsa Craig') were characterized in terms of root apical meristem and elongation zone histology, expression of the cell-cycle marker gene Sl-CycB1;1, accumulation of ROS, response to auxin and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and expression of ROS-related mRNAs.Key ResultsThe dgt mutant exhibited histological defects in the root apical meristem and elongation zone and displayed a constitutively increased level of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in the root tip, part of which was detected in the apoplast. Treatments of wild-type with auxin increased the H 2 O 2 concentration in the root tip in a dose-dependent manner. Auxin and H 2 O 2 elicited similar inhibition of cell elongation while bringing forth differential responses in terms of meristem length and number of cells in the elongation zone. Auxin treatments affected the expression of mRNAs of ROS-scavenging enzymes and less significantly mRNAs related to antioxidant level. The dgt mutation resulted in resistance to both auxin and H 2 O 2 and affected profoundly the expression of mRNAs related to antioxidant level. Conclusions The results indicate that auxin regulates the level of H 2 O 2 in the root tip, so increasing the auxin level triggers accumulation of H 2 O 2 leading to inhibition of root cell elongation and root growth. The dgt mutation affects this pathway by reducing the auxin responsiveness of tissues and by disrupting the H 2 O 2 homeostasis in the root tip. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.

Very few attempts have been made to enhance stomatal opening with the goal of increasing photosynthesis and plant growth, even though stomatal resistance is thought to be the major limiting factor for CO2 uptake by plants. Here, we show that transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing H+-ATPase using the strong guard cell promoter GC1 showed enhanced light-induced stomatal opening, photosynthesis, and plant growth. The transgenic plants produced larger and increased numbers of rosette leaves, with {\~{}}42-63{\%} greater fresh and dry weights than the wild type in the first 25 d of growth.

In addition, stomata in the transgenic plants closed normally in response to darkness and abscisic acid. In contrast, the overexpression of phototropin or inward-rectifying K + channels in guard cells had no effect on these phenotypes. These results demonstrate that stomatal aperture is a limiting factor in photosynthesis and plant growth, and that manipulation of stomatal opening by overexpressing H+-ATPase in guard cells is useful for the promotion of plant growth.},

Cucumber leaf shapes are diverse; however, the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying leaf shape formation are unknown. In this study, we obtained a round leaf mutant (rl) from an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutagenesis population. Genetic analysis revealed that a single recessive gene, rl, is responsible for this mutation. A modified MutMap analysis combined linkage mapping identified a single nucleotide polymorphism within a candidate gene, Csa1M537400, as the mutation underlying the trait. Csa1M537400 encodes a PINOID kinase protein involved in auxin transport. Expression of Csa1M537400 was significantly lower in the rl mutant than in wild type, and it displayed higher levels of IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) in several tissues. Treatment of wild-type plants with an auxin transport inhibitor induced the formation of round leaves, similar to those in the rl mutant. Altered expression patterns of several auxin-related genes in the rl mutant suggest that rl plays a key role in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and response in cucumber. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of auxin signaling pathways in cucumber, and will be valuable in the development of an ideal plant type.},

Because of the distinct requirements for microtubules and actin filaments during leaf trichome development, a trichome-based morphology screen is an efficient approach to identify genes that affect cytoplasmic organization. The seedling lethal spike1 mutant was identified based on trichome, cotyledon, and leaf-shape defects. The predicted SPIKE1 protein shares amino acid identity with a large family of adapter proteins present in humans, flies, and worms that integrate extracellular signals with cytoskeletal reorganization. Both the trichome phenotype and immunolocalization data suggest that SPIKE1 also is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. The assembly of laterally clustered foci of microtubules and polarized growth are early events in cotyledon development, and both processes are misregulated in spike1 epidermal cells.},

In this context, a range of developmental phenomena can be explained by the regulation of cell surface tension. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Division plane determination in plant cells involves the transformation of the cortical microtubular array into a preprophase band (PPB) with the nucleus anchored at the center. This likely occurs through polarity cues controlling proteins affecting cytoskeletal dynamics. Crosstalk with cell cycle machinery should assure that this happens in concert with cell cycle progression. Before PPB breakdown, targeted deposition of factors at the position of the PPB translates this position into a signal which remains present throughout cytokinesis and directs the centrifugal growing cell plate to the correct cortical position. Anchoring and maturation of the cell plate ultimately divides the two daughter cells.

The phytohormone auxin influences the position of this niche by an unknown mechanism. Here, we identify the PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2 genes encoding AP2 class putative transcription factors, which are essential for QC specification and stem cell activity. The PLT genes are transcribed in response to auxin accumulation and are dependent on auxin response transcription factors. Distal PLT transcript accumulation creates an overlap with the radial expression domains of SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW, providing positional information for the stem cell niche. Furthermore, the PLT genes are activated in the basal embryo region that gives rise to hypocotyl, root, and root stem cells and, when ectopically expressed, transform apical regions to these identities. Thus, the PLT genes are key effectors for establishment of the stem cell niche during embryonic pattern formation.},

abstract = {To explore the role of auxin-binding protein (ABP1) in planta, a number of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) lines were generated. The wild-type KDEL endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal was mutated to HDEL, another common retention sequence in plants, and to KEQL or KDELGL to compromise its activity. The auxin-binding kinetics of these forms of ABP1 were found to be similar to those of ABP1 purified from maize (Zea mays). To test for a physiological response mediated by auxin, intact guard cells of the transgenic plants were impaled with double-barreled microelectrodes, and auxin-dependent changes in K+ currents were recorded under voltage clamp. Exogenous auxin affected inwardly and outwardly rectifying K+ currents in a dose-dependent manner. Auxin sensitivity was markedly enhanced in all plants overexpressing ABP1, irrespective of the form present. Immunogold electron microscopy was used to investigate the localization of ABP1 in the transgenic plants. All forms were detected in the endoplasmic reticulum and the KEQL and KDELGL forms passed further across the Golgi stacks than KDEL and HDEL forms. However, neither electron microscopy nor silver-enhanced immunogold epipolarization microscopy revealed differences in cell surface ABP1 abundance for any of the plants, including control plants, which indicated that overexpression of ABP1 alone was sufficient to confer increased sensitivity to added auxin. Jones et al. ([1998] Science 282: 1114-1117) found increased cell expansion in transgenic plants overexpressing wild-type ABP1. Single cell recordings extend this observation, with the demonstration that the auxin sensitivity of guard cell K+ currents is mediated, at least in part, by ABP1.},

abstract = {Microtubules have a key role in plant morphogenesis, as they control the oriented deposition of cellulose in the cell wall, and thus growth anisotropy. The idea that mechanical stress could be one of the main determinants behind the orientation of microtubules in plant cells emerged very soon after their discovery. The cause of mechanical stress in plant cells is turgor pressure, which can build up to 1 MPa and is restrained by cell wall stiffness. On the tissue scale, this can lead to regional patterns of tension, in particular in the epidermis of aerial organs, which resist the stress generated by cells in internal tissues. Here we summarize more than 50 years of work on the contribution of mechanical stress in guiding microtubule behavior, and the resulting impact on growth anisotropy and growth heterogeneity. We propose a conceptual model on microtubule dynamics and their ability to self-organize in bundles parallel to the direction of maximal stress, as well as a synthetic representation of the putative mechanotransducers at play. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors The Plant Journal {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The phytohormone auxin is a major regulator of diverse aspects of plant growth and development. The ubiquitin-ligase complex SCF(TIR1/AFB) (for Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein), which includes the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB) auxin receptor family, has recently been demonstrated to be critical for auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation. Early-phase auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation, on the other hand, has long been explained by the acid-growth theory, for which proton extrusion by the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase is a functional prerequisite. However, the mechanism by which auxin mediates H(+)-ATPase activation has yet to be elucidated. Here, we present direct evidence for H(+)-ATPase activation in etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by auxin through phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine during early-phase hypocotyl elongation. Application of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to endogenous auxin-depleted hypocotyl sections induced phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine of the H(+)-ATPase and increased H(+)-ATPase activity without altering the amount of the enzyme. Changes in both the phosphorylation level of H(+)-ATPase and IAA-induced elongation were similarly concentration dependent. Furthermore, IAA-induced H(+)-ATPase phosphorylation occurred in a tir1-1 afb2-3 double mutant, which is severely defective in auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation. In addition, $\alpha$-(phenylethyl-2-one)-IAA, the auxin antagonist specific for the nuclear auxin receptor TIR1/AFBs, had no effect on IAA-induced H(+)-ATPase phosphorylation. These results suggest that the TIR1/AFB auxin receptor family is not involved in auxin-induced H(+)-ATPase phosphorylation. Our results define the activation mechanism of H(+)-ATPase by auxin during early-phase hypocotyl elongation; this is the long-sought-after mechanism that is central to the acid-growth theory.},

abstract = {We investigated the short day (SD)-induced transition to dormancy in wild-type hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides) and its absence in transgenic poplar overexpressing heterologous PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA). CENTRORADIALIS-LIKE1 (CENL1), a poplar ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1), was markedly downregulated in the wild-type apex coincident with SD-induced growth cessation. By contrast, poplar overexpressing a heterologous Avena sativa PHYA construct (P35S:AsPHYA), with PHYA accumulating in the rib meristem (RM) and adjacent tissues but not in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), upregulated CENL1 in the RM area coincident with an acceleration of stem elongation. In SD-exposed heterografts, both P35S:AsPHYA and wild-type scions ceased growth and formed buds, whereas only the wild type assumed dormancy and P35S:AsPHYA showed repetitive flushing. This shows that the transition is not dictated by leaf-produced signals but dependent on RM and SAM properties. In view of this, callose-enforced cell isolation in the SAM, associated with suspension of indeterminate growth during dormancy, may require downregulation of CENL1 in the RM. Accordingly, upregulation of CENL1/TFL1 might promote stem elongation in poplar as well as in Arabidopsis during bolting. Together, the results suggest that the RM is particularly sensitive to photoperiodic signals and that CENL1 in the RM influences transition to dormancy in hybrid poplar. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

Localization does not depend on tissue context, requires cell wall integrity and is defined by a transferrable, protein-specific motif. A Domain of Unknown Function in SOSEKI proteins resembles the DIX oligomerization domain in the animal Dishevelled polarity regulator. The DIX-like domain self-interacts and is required for edge localization and for influencing division orientation, together with a second domain that defines the polar membrane domain. Our work shows that SOSEKI proteins locally interpret global polarity cues and can influence cell division orientation. Furthermore, this work reveals that, despite fundamental differences, cell polarity mechanisms in plants and animals converge on a similar protein domain.},

All parameters tested, i.e., temperature, light intensity and day length had a strong impact on the number of sporophytes formed. The highest number of sporophytes, 559 g fresh weight, developed at 15°C, 8 h light/day with an intensity of 20 $\mu$mol/m2/s. In contrast, at 25°C, as well as with a day length of 16 h per day, the number of sporophytes was drastically reduced. Vegetative growth, determined as fresh weight per petri dish, was impeded under conditions favouring sporophyte formation, probably due to nutrient transfer to the sporophytes. Microscopic documentation of the developing sporophytes revealed that, although archegonia were arranged in bundles at the gametophore apices, usually only one archegonium per gametophore apex developed into a mature sporophyte. From an EST database six novel MADS-box genes were identified which, in phylogenetic analyses, did not cluster with the known groups of higher plant MADS-box genes. One of these genes was represented only as a singleton in a cDNA library specifically derived from gametophore apices and developing sporophytes, and, therefore, designated PpMADS-S. RNA amounts of PpMADS-S were two to three times higher under conditions that stimulate sporophyte development (15°C, 8 h light per day) when compared to conditions favouring vegetative growth (25°C, 16 h light per day), indicating a possible function in sexual reproduction of this moss. Thus, an efficient experimental system was established to study sex organ formation, fertilization and embryo development in Physcomitrella.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the formation of stripes of expression of the pair-rule gene eve. We identify detailed mechanisms which control the formation of stripes 2-5. Each stripe is formed as a result of generalized activation by bcd and ubiquitous transcription factors combined with localized repression by gap genes. Each of the eight stripe borders of these four stripes is shown to be under the control of a particular gap gene expression domain. Protein synthesis from eve and its controlling gap genes begins at the same time, but localized eve expression is substantially delayed relative to localized expression of gap domains. We show that this delay results from a change in the spatial balance between activation and repression due to the intensification and refinement of gap domains during cleavage cycle 14. eve stripe formation is ordered in time; stripe 2 appears earlier than stripes 3-5. We show that this happens because the formation of stripe 2 is less dependent on gap domain refinement than is the case for stripes 3-5: Each of stripes 3-5 is controlled by a pair of overlapping gap domains, whereas stripe 2 is controlled by a disjoint pair of gap domains. Finally, we observe that eve stripes do not form unless Eve protein has an extremely small diffusivity, and argue that this low diffusivity is a result of the apical localization of pair-rule message. This implies that localization of pair-rule message is required for stripe formation. The essential tool used to obtain these results is the method of gene circuits, which is a new approach to the analysis of gene expression data. Its purpose is to provide a way to use this data to infer how concentrations of products of a given gene change with time and how these changes are influenced by the activating or repressing effects of the products of other genes. The gene circuit method is based on three main ideas, explained in the paper. First is the choice of protein concentrations as state variables for the description of gene regulation. Second is the summary of chemical reaction kinetics by coarse-grained rate equations for protein concentrations. Third is the use of least squares fits to gene expression data to measure phenomenological parameters occurring in the gene circuit. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Organisms as diverse as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals manifest a property called “polarity.” The literature shows that polarity emerges as a consequence of different mechanisms in different lineages. However, across all unicellular and multicellular organisms, polarity is evident when cells, organs, or organisms manifest one or more of the following: orientation, axiation, and asymmetry. Here, we review the relationships among these three features in the context of cell division and the evolution of multicellular polarity primarily in plants (defined here to include the algae). Data from unicellular and unbranched filamentous organisms (e.g., Chlamydomonas and Ulothrix) show that cell orientation and axiation are marked by cytoplasmic asymmetries. Branched filamentous organisms (e.g., Cladophora and moss protonema) require an orthogonal reorientation of axiation, or a localized cell asymmetry (e.g., “tip” growth in pollen tubes and fungal hyphae). The evolution of complex multicellular meristematic polarity required a third reorientation of axiation. These transitions show that polarity and the orientation of the future plane(s) of cell division are dyadic dynamical patterning modules that were critical for multicellular eukaryotic organisms.},

Here we study the shape of tip-growing, walled cells, which have evolved a polar mode of cell morphogenesis leading to characteristic filamentous cell morphologies that extend only apically. • Methods: We identified the relevant parameters for the control of cell shape and derived scaling laws based on mass conservation and force balance that connect these parameters to the resulting geometrical phenotypes. These laws provide quantitative testable relations linking morphological phenotypes to the biophysical processes involved in establishing and modulating cell shape in tip-growing, walled cells. • Key results and conclusions: By comparing our theoretical results to the observed morphological variation within and across species, we found that tip-growing cells from plant and fungal species share a common strategy to shape the cell, whereas oomycete species have evolved a different mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2012 Botanical Society of America.},

However, analysis of early embryo development and tissue morphogenesis has highlighted the role of the spatial distribution of cortical cues able to guide spindle orientation. In vitro studies of cell division have revealed similar mechanisms. Recent data support the possibility that the orientation of cell division in mammalian cells is dominated by cell adhesion and the associated traction forces developed in interphase. Cell shape is a manifestation of these adhesive and tensional patterns. These patterns control the spatial distribution of cortical signals and thereby guide spindle orientation and daughter cell positioning.

From the analysis of tip shape and microsphere movements, we propose three characteristic zones of expansion in growing root hairs. The center of the apical dome is an area of 1- to 2-$\mu$m diameter with relatively constant curvature and high growth rate. Distal to the apex is a more rapidly expanding region 1 to 2 $\mu$m in width exhibiting constant surges of off-axis growth. This middle region forms an annulus of maximum growth rate and is visible as an area of accentuated curvature in the tip profile. The remainder of the apical dome is characterized by strong radial expansion anisotropy where the meridional rate of expansion falls below the radial expansion rate. Data also suggest possible meridional contraction at the juncture between the apical dome anti the cell body. The cell cylinder distal to the tip expands slightly over time, but only around the circumference. These data for surface expansion in the legume root hair provide new insight into the mechanism of tip growth and the morphogenesis of the root hair.},

abstract = {Tissue patterning in multicellular organisms is the output of precise spatio–temporal regulation of gene expression coupled with changes in hormone dynamics. In plants, the hormone auxin regulates growth and development at every stage of a plant's life cycle. Auxin signaling occurs through binding of the auxin molecule to a TIR1/AFB F-box ubiquitin ligase, allowing interaction with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins. These are subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded via the 26S proteasome, leading to derepression of auxin response factors (ARFs). How auxin is able to elicit such a diverse range of developmental responses through a single signaling module has not yet been resolved. Here we present an alternative auxin-sensing mechanism in which the ARF ARF3/ETTIN controls gene expression through interactions with process-specific transcription factors. This noncanonical hormonesensing mechanism exhibits strong preference for the naturally occurring auxin indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) and is important for coordinating growth and patterning in diverse developmental contexts such as gynoecium morphogenesis, lateral root emergence, ovule development, and primary branch formation. Disrupting this IAA-sensing ability induces morphological aberrations with consequences for plant fitness. Therefore, our findings introduce a novel transcription factor-based mechanism of hormone perception in plants.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis occurs in 3D space over time and is guided by coordinated gene expression programs. Here we use postembryonic development in Arabidopsis plants to investigate the genetic control of growth. We demonstrate that gene expression driving the production of the growth-stimulating hormone gibberellic acid and downstream growth factors is first induced within the radicle tip of the embryo. The center of cell expansion is, however, spatially displaced from the center of gene expression. Because the rapidly growing cells have very different geometry from that of those at the tip, we hypothesized that mechanical factors may contribute to this growth displacement. To this end we developed 3D finite-element method models of growing custom-designed digital embryos at cellular resolution. We used this framework to conceptualize how cell size, shape, and topology influence tissue growth and to explore the interplay of geometrical and genetic inputs into growth distribution. Our simulations showed that mechanical constraints are sufficient to explain the disconnect between the experimentally observed spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and early post-embryonic growth. The center of cell expansion is the position where genetic and mechanical facilitators of growth converge. We have thus uncovered a mechanism whereby 3D cellular geometry helps direct where genetically specified growth takes place.},

Here we present our unexpected findings that ABP1 is neither required for auxin signaling nor necessary for plant development under normal growth conditions. We used our ribozyme-based CRISPR technology to generate an Arabidopsis abp1 mutant that contains a 5-bp deletion in the first exon of ABP1, which resulted in a frameshift and introduction of early stop codons. We also identified a T-DNA insertion abp1 allele that harbors a T-DNA insertion located 27 bp downstream of the ATG start codon in the first exon. We show that the two new abp1 mutants are null alleles. Surprisingly, our new abp1 mutant plants do not display any obvious developmental defects. In fact, the mutant plants are indistinguishable from wild-type plants at every developmental stage analyzed. Furthermore, the abp1 plants are not resistant to exogenous auxin. At the molecular level, we find that the induction of known auxin-regulated genes is similar in both wild-type and abp1 plants in response to auxin treatments. We conclude that ABP1 is not a key component in auxin signaling or Arabidopsis development.},

Leaves and flowers are formed from the shoot apical meristem, triggered by the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is transported through plant tissues by specific cellular influx and efflux carrier proteins. Here we show that proteins involved in auxin transport regulate phyllotaxis. Our data indicate that auxin is transported upwards into the meristem through the epidermis and the outermost meristem cell layer. Existing leaf primordia act as sinks, redistributing auxin and creating its heterogeneous distribution in the meristem. Auxin accumulation occurs only at certain minimal distances from existing primordia, defining the position of future primordia. This model for phyllotaxis accounts for its reiterative nature, as well as its regularity and stability.},

Recent findings on the directional movement of the plant signalling molecule auxin provide a unique connection between individual cell polarity and the establishment of polarity at the tissue, organ, and whole-plant levels. Decisions about the subcellular polar targeting of PIN auxin transport components determine the direction of auxin flow between cells and consequently mediate multiple developmental events. In addition, mutations or chemical interference with PIN-based auxin transport result in abnormal cell divisions. Thus, the complicated links between cell polarity establishment, auxin transport, cytoskeleton, and oriented cell divisions now begin to emerge.

abstract = {All cellular compartments are separated from the external environment by a membrane, which consists of a lipid bilayer. Subcellular structures, including clathrin-coated pits, caveolae, filopodia, lamellipodia, podosomes, and other intracellular membrane systems, are molded into their specific submicron-scale shapes through various mechanisms. Cells construct their micro-structures on plasma membrane and execute vital functions for life, such as cell migration, cell division, endocytosis, exocytosis, and cytoskeletal regulation. The plasma membrane, rich in anionic phospholipids, utilizes the electrostatic nature of the lipids, specifically the phosphoinositides, to form interactions with cytosolic proteins. These cytosolic proteins have three modes of interaction: 1) electrostatic interaction through unstructured polycationic regions, 2) through structured phosphoinositide-specific binding domains, and 3) through structured domains that bind the membrane without specificity for particular phospholipid. Among the structured domains, there are several that have membrane-deforming activity, which is essential for the formation of concave or convex membrane curvature. These domains include the amphipathic helix, which deforms the membrane by hemi-insertion of the helix with both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and/or the BAR domain superfamily, known to use their positively charged, curved structural surface to deform membranes. Below the membrane, actin filaments support the micro-structures through interactions with several BAR proteins as well as other scaffold proteins, resulting in outward and inward membrane micro-structure formation. Here, we describe the characteristics of phospholipids, and the mechanisms utilized by phosphoinositides to regulate cellular events. We then summarize the precise mechanisms underlying the construction of membrane micro-structures and their involvements in physiological and pathological processes.},

This variability was strongly decreased in a mutant impaired in the microtubule-severing protein katanin. Major shape defects in the mutant could be related to a local decrease in growth heterogeneity. We show that katanin is required for the cell's competence to respond to the mechanical forces generated by growth. This provides the basis for a model in which microtubule dynamics allow the cell to respond efficiently to mechanical forces. This in turn can amplify local growth-rate gradients, yielding more heterogeneous growth and supporting morphogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we compared the predictions of a mathematical model of epithelial growth with the morphological analysis of 3D epithelial structures. In both in vitro cyst models and in developing epithelial structures in vivo, epithelial growth could take place close to or far from mechanical equilibrium, and was determined by the hierarchy of time-scales of cell division, cell-cell rearrangements, and lumen dynamics. Equilibrium properties could be inferred by the analysis of cell-cell contact topologies, and the nonequilibrium phenotype was altered by inhibiting ROCK activity. The occurrence of an aberrant multilumen phenotype was linked to fast nonequilibrium growth, even when geometric control of cell division was correctly enforced.

abstract = {A plant's lateral structures, such as leaves, branches and flowers, literally hinge on the shoot axis, making its integrity and growth fundamental to plant form. In all plants, subapical proliferation within the shoot tip displaces cells downward to extrude the cylindrical stem. Following the transition to flowering, many plants show extensive axial elongation associated with increased subapical proliferation and expansion. However, the cereal grasses also elongate their stems, called culms, due to activity within detached intercalary meristems which displaces cells upward, elevating the grain-bearing inflorescence. Variation in culm length within species is especially relevant to cereal crops, as demonstrated by the high-yielding semi-dwarfed cereals of the Green Revolution. Although previously understudied, recent renewed interest the regulation of subapical and intercalary growth suggests that control of cell division planes, boundary formation and temporal dynamics of differentiation, are likely critical mechanisms coordinating axial growth and development in plants.},

In particular, normal patterns of organogenesis in plants require coordination between growth direction and growth magnitude. How this is achieved remains unclear. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, auxin patterning and cellular growth are linked through a correlated pattern of auxin efflux carrier localization and cortical microtubule orientation. Our experiments reveal that both PIN1 localization and microtubule array orientation are likely to respond to a shared upstream regulator that appears to be biomechanical in nature. Lastly, through mathematical modeling we show that such a biophysical coupling could mediate the feedback loop between auxin and its transport that underlies plant phyllotaxis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Heisler et al.},

abstract = {Proper orientation of the cell division axis is critical for asymmetric cell divisions that underpin cell differentiation. In animals, centrosomes are the dominant microtubule organizing centers (MTOC) and play a pivotal role in axis determination by orienting the mitotic spindle. In land plants that lack centrosomes, a critical role of a microtubular ring structure, the preprophase band (PPB), has been observed in this process; the PPB is required for orienting (before prophase) and guiding (in telophase) the mitotic apparatus. However, plants must possess additional mechanisms to control the division axis, as certain cell types or mutants do not form PPBs. Here, using live imaging of the gametophore of the mossPhyscomitrella patens, we identified acentrosomal MTOCs, which we termed "gametosomes," appearing de novo and transiently in the prophase cytoplasm independent of PPB formation. We show that gametosomes are dispensable for spindle formation but required for metaphase spindle orientation. In some cells, gametosomes appeared reminiscent of the bipolar MT "polar cap" structure that forms transiently around the prophase nucleus in angiosperms. Specific disruption of the polar caps in tobacco cells misoriented the metaphase spindles and frequently altered the final division plane, indicating that they are functionally analogous to the gametosomes. These results suggest a broad use of transient MTOC structures as the spindle orientation machinery in plants, compensating for the evolutionary loss of centrosomes, to secure the initial orientation of the spindle in a spatial window that allows subsequent fine-tuning of the division plane axis by the guidance machinery.},

Multilevel regulations of PIN activity under internal and external cues are complicated; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that 3'-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinase1 (PDK1), which is conserved in plants and mammals, functions as a molecular hub integrating the upstream lipid signalling and the downstream substrate activity through phosphorylation. Genetic analysis uncovers that loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant pdk1.1 pdk1.2 exhibits a plethora of abnormalities in organogenesis and growth, due to the defective PIN-dependent auxin transport. Further cellular and biochemical analyses reveal that PDK1 phosphorylates D6 Protein Kinase to facilitate its activity towards PIN proteins. Our studies establish a lipid-dependent phosphorylation cascade connecting membrane composition-based cellular signalling with plant growth and patterning by regulating morphogenetic auxin fluxes.},

abstract = {Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally.},

Our experiments also revealed that the plasma membrane phosphatidylserine content varies during plant root development and that the level of phosphatidylserine modulates the quantity of ROP6 nanoclusters induced by auxin and hence downstream signaling, including regulation of endocytosis and gravitropism.

Here, we demonstrate that RCC1-like domain (RLD) proteins, identified as LZY interactors, are essential regulators of polar auxin transport. We show that interaction of the CCL domain of LZY with the BRX domain of RLD is important for the recruitment of RLD from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane by LZY. A structural analysis reveals the mode of the interaction as an intermolecular $\beta$-sheet in addition to the structure of the BRX domain.

abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is required for cell expansion and is implicated in cellular responses to the plant growth hormone auxin. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that coordinate auxin signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell expansion are poorly understood. Previous studies have examined actin cytoskeleton responses to long-term auxin treatment, but plants respond to auxin over short timeframes, and growth changes within minutes of exposure to the hormone. To correlate actin arrays with degree of cell expansion, we used quantitative imaging tools to establish a baseline of actin organization, as well as of individual filament behaviors in root epidermal cells under control conditions and after treatment with a known inhibitor of root growth, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We found that cell length was highly predictive of actin array in control roots, and that short-term IAA treatment stimulated denser, more longitudinal, and more parallel arrays by inducing filament unbundling within minutes. By demonstrating that actin filaments were more “organized” after a treatment that stopped elongation, we show there is no direct relationship between actin organization and cell expansion and refute the hypothesis that “more organized” actin universally correlates with more rapidly growing root cells. The plasma membrane-bound auxin transporter AUXIN RESISTANT 1 (AUX1) has previously been shown necessary for archetypal short-term root growth inhibition in the presence of IAA. Although AUX1 was not previously suspected of being upstream of cytoskeletal responses to IAA, we used aux1 mutants to demonstrate that AUX1 is necessary for the full complement of actin rearrangements in response to auxin, and that cytoplasmic auxin in the form of NAA is sufficient to stimulate a partial actin response. Together, these results are the first to quantitate actin cytoskeleton response to short-term auxin treatments and demonstrate that AUX1 is necessary for short-term actin remodeling.

Using this approach, the effects of several mitotic drugs on meristem development were studied. Oryzalin (depolymerizing microtubules) very rapidly caused cell division arrest. Nevertheless, both cell expansion and cell differentiation proceeded in the treated meristems. Interestingly, DNA synthesis was not blocked, and the meristematic cells went through several rounds of endoreduplication in the presence of the drug. We next treated the meristems with two inhibitors of DNA synthesis, aphidicolin and hydroxyurea.

Rhizoids are multicellular filaments that develop from the epidermis in a wide range of plants, including pteridophytes, bryophytes, and green algae; they have similar functions to root hairs in vascular plants in that they support the plant body and are involved in water and nutrient absorption. In this study, we examined mechanisms underlying rhizoid development in the moss, Physcomitrella patens, which is the only land plant in which high-frequency gene targeting is possible. We found that rhizoid development can be split into two processes: determination and differentiation. Two types of rhizoids with distinct developmental patterns (basal and mid-stem rhizoids) were recognized. The development of basal rhizoids from epidermal cells was induced by exogenous auxin, while that of mid-stem rhizoids required an unknown factor in addition to exogenous auxin. Once an epidermal cell had acquired a rhizoid initial cell fate, expression of the homeodomain-leucine zipper I gene Pphb7 was induced. Analysis of Pphb7 disruptant lines showed that Pphb7 affects the induction of pigmentation and the increase in the number and size of chloroplasts, but not the position or number of rhizoids. This is the first report on the involvement of a homeodomain-leucine zipper I gene in epidermal cell differentiation.},

abstract = {Although genetic control of morphogenesis is well established, elaboration of complex shapes requires changes in the mechanical properties of cells. In plants, the first visible sign of leaf formation is a bulge on the flank of the shoot apical meristem. Bulging results from local relaxation of cell walls, which causes them to yield to internal hydrostatic pressure. By manipulation of tissue tension in combination with quantitative live imaging and finite-element modeling, we found that the slow-growing area at the shoot tip is substantially strain-stiffened compared with surrounding fast-growing tissue. We propose that strain stiffening limits growth, restricts organ bulging, and contributes to the meristem's functional zonation. Thus, mechanical signals are not just passive readouts of gene action but feed back on morphogenesis.},

abstract = {RAB GTPases are key regulators of membrane traffic. Among them, RAB11, a widely conserved sub-group, has evolved in a unique way in plants; plant RAB11 members show notable diversity, whereas yeast and animals have only a few RAB11 members. Fifty-seven RAB GTPases are encoded in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, 26 of which are classified in the RAB11 group (further divided into RABA1-RABA6 sub-groups). Although several plant RAB11 members have been shown to play pivotal roles in plant-unique developmental processes, including cytokinesis and tip growth, molecular and physiological functions of the majority of RAB11 members remain unknown. To reveal precise functions of plant RAB11, we investigated the subcellular localization and dynamics of the largest sub-group of Arabidopsis RAB11, RABA1, which has nine members. RABA1 members reside on mobile punctate structures adjacent to the trans-Golgi network and co-localized with VAMP721/722, R-SNARE proteins that operate in the secretory pathway. In addition, the constitutiveactive mutant of RABA1b, RABA1bQ72L, was present on the plasma membrane. The RABA1b-containing membrane structures showed actin-dependent dynamic motion. Vesicles labeled by GFP-RABA1b moved dynamically, forming queues along actin filaments. Interestingly, Arabidopsis plants whose four major RABA1 members were knocked out, and those expressing the dominant-negative mutant of RABA1B, exhibited hypersensitivity to salinity stress. Altogether, these results indicate that RABA1 members mediate transport between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane, and are required for salinity stress tolerance. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Cell migration is fundamental in both animal morphogenesis and disease. The migration of individual cells is relatively well-studied; however, in vivo, cells often remain joined by cell-cell junctions and migrate in cohesive groups. How such groups of cells coordinate their migration is poorly understood. The planar polarity pathway coordinates the polarity of non-migrating cells in epithelial sheets and is required for cell rearrangements during vertebrate morphogenesis. It is therefore a good candidate to play a role in the collective migration of groups of cells. Drosophila border cell migration is a well-characterised and genetically tractable model of collective cell migration, during which a group of about six to ten epithelial cells detaches from the anterior end of the developing egg chamber and migrates invasively towards the oocyte. We find that the planar polarity pathway promotes this invasive migration, acting both in the migrating cells themselves and in the non-migratory polar follicle cells that they carry along. Disruption of planar polarity signalling causes abnormalities in actin-rich processes on the cell surface and leads to less-efficient migration. This is apparently due, in part, to a loss of regulation of Rho GTPase activity by the planar polarity receptor Frizzled, which itself becomes localised to the migratory edge of the border cells. We conclude that, during collective cell migration, the planar polarity pathway can mediate communication between motile and non-motile cells, which enhances the efficiency of migration via the modulation of actin dynamics.},

We used homologous landmarks fixed to the outer walls of pavement cells and thin-plate spline analysis to demonstrate that lobes form by differential growth of both the anticlinal and periclinal walls. Most lobes formed within the first 24 h of the cotyledons unfurling, during the period of rapid cell expansion. Cortical microtubules adjacent to the periclinal wall were persistently enriched at the convex side of lobes during development where growth was anisotropic and were less concentrated or absent at the concave side where growth was promoted. Alternating microtubule-enriched and microtubule-free zones at the periclinal wall in neighboring cells predicted sites of new lobes. There was no particular arrangement of cortical actin filaments that could predict where lobes would form. However, drug studies demonstrate that both filamentous actin and microtubules are required for lobe formation.},

Walls are fairly rigid to provide support and protection, but also extensible, to allow cell growth, which is triggered by a high intracellular turgor pressure. Wall properties regulate the differential growth of the cell, resulting in a diversity of cell sizes and shapes. The plant hormone auxin is well known to stimulate cell elongation via increasing wall extensibility. Auxin participates in the regulation of cell wall properties by inducing wall loosening. Here, we review what is known on cell wall property regulation by auxin. We focus particularly on the auxin role during cell expansion linked directly to cell wall modifications. We also analyze downstream targets of transcriptional auxin signaling, which are related to the cell wall and could be linked to acid growth and the action of wall-loosening proteins.

This is largely dependent on the ability of plants to form new organs, such as lateral roots, leaves, and flowers during postembryonic development. Organ primordia develop from founder cell populations into organs by coordinated cell division and differentiation. Here, we show that organ formation in Arabidopsis involves dynamic gradients of the signaling molecule auxin with maxima at the primordia tips. These gradients are mediated by cellular efflux requiring asymmetrically localized PIN proteins, which represent a functionally redundant network for auxin distribution in both aerial and underground organs. PIN1 polar localization undergoes a dynamic rearrangement, which correlates with establishment of auxin gradients and primordium development. Our results suggest that PIN-dependent, local auxin gradients represent a common module for formation of all plant organs, regardless of their mature morphology or developmental origin.},

It has been assumed to operate in an evolutionary conserved manner as in yeast and animals. Here we report characterisation of ultrastructure, dynamics and mechanisms of plant CME as allowed by our advancement in electron microscopy and quantitative live imaging techniques. Arabidopsis CME follows the constant curvature model and the bona fide CME population generates vesicles of a predominantly hexagonal type; larger and with faster kinetics than in other models. Contrary to the existing paradigm, actin is dispensable for CME events at the surface but plays a unique role in collecting endocytic vesicles, sorting of internalised cargos and directional endosome movement that itself actively promote CME events. Internalized vesicles display a strongly delayed and sequential uncoating. These unique features highlight the independent evolution of the plant CME mechanism during the autonomous rise of multicellularity in eukaryotes.},

This fast auxin effect requires auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1) and involves a contribution of downstream signalling components such as ROP6 GTPase, ROP-interactive protein RIC1 and the microtubule-severing protein katanin.

Here we demonstrate that 3'-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinase1 (PDK1), which is conserved in plants and mammals, functions as a molecular hub integrating the upstream lipid signalling and the downstream substrate activity through phosphorylation. Genetic analysis uncovers that loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant pdk1.1 pdk1.2 exhibits a plethora of abnormalities in organogenesis and growth, due to the defective PIN-dependent auxin transport. Further cellular and biochemical analyses reveal that PDK1 phosphorylates D6 Protein Kinase to facilitate its activity towards PIN proteins.

abstract = {Although the vertebrate limb bud has been studied for decades as a model system for spatial pattern formation and cell specification, the cellular basis of its distally oriented elongation has been a relatively neglected topic by comparison. The conventional view is that a gradient of isotropic proliferation exists along the limb, with high proliferation rates at the distal tip and lower rates towards the body, and that this gradient is the driving force behind outgrowth. Here we test this hypothesis by combining quantitative empirical data sets with computer modelling to assess the potential role of spatially controlled proliferation rates in the process of directional limb bud outgrowth. In particular, we generate two new empirical data sets for the mouse hind limb-a numerical description of shape change and a quantitative 3D map of cell cycle times-and combine these with a new 3D finite element model of tissue growth. By developing a parameter optimization approach (which explores spatial patterns of tissue growth) our computer simulations reveal that the observed distribution of proliferation rates plays no significant role in controlling the distally extending limb shape, and suggests that directional cell activities are likely to be the driving force behind limb bud outgrowth. This theoretical prediction prompted us to search for evidence of directional cell orientations in the limb bud mesenchyme, and we thus discovered a striking highly branched and extended cell shape composed of dynamically extending and retracting filopodia, a distally oriented bias in Golgi position, and also a bias in the orientation of cell division. We therefore provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that limb bud elongation is achieved by directional cell activities, rather than a PD gradient of proliferation rates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Boehm et al.},

We study this issue here in the shoot meristem of higher plants, a group of undifferentiated cells where complex changes in growth rates and directions lead to the continuous formation of new organs [1, 2]. Here, we show that the plant hormone auxin plays an important role in this process via a dual, local effect on the extracellular matrix, the cell wall, which determines cell shape. Our study reveals that auxin not only causes a limited reduction in wall stiffness but also directly interferes with wall anisotropy via the regulation of cortical microtubule dynamics. We further show that to induce growth isotropy and organ outgrowth, auxin somehow interferes with the cortical microtubule-ordering activity of a network of proteins, including AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN 1 and KATANIN 1. Numerical simulations further indicate that the induced isotropy is sufficient to amplify the effects of the relatively minor changes in wall stiffness to promote organogenesis and the establishment of new growth axes in a robust manner.},

However, oxygen radical chemistry may also play a useful role in polymer breakdown leading to wall loosening during extension growth of plant cells controlled by the phytohormone auxin. Backbone cleavage of cell wall polysaccharides can be accomplished in vitro by .OH produced from H2O2 in a Fenton reaction or in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase supplied with O2 and NADH. Here, we show that coleoptile growth of maize seedlings is accompanied by the release of reactive oxygen intermediates in the cell wall. Auxin promotes release of O2.- and subsequent generation of .OH when inducing elongation growth. Experimental generation of .OH in the wall causes an increase in wall extensibility in vitro and replaces auxin in inducing growth. Auxin-induced growth can be inhibited by scavengers of O2.-, H2O2 or .OH, or inhibitors interfering with the formation of these molecules in the cell wall. These results provide the experimental background for a novel hypothesis on the mechanism of plant cell growth in which .OH, produced from O2.- and H2O2 by cell wall peroxidase, acts as a wall-loosening agent.},

In both contexts cells migrate either individually, as loosely associated sheets or as clusters of cells. In this review, we summarize, compare and integrate knowledge gained from several in vivo model systems that have yielded insights into the regulation of morphogenic cell migration, such as the zebrafish lateral line primordium and primordial germ cells, Drosophila border cell clusters, vertebrate neural crest migration and angiogenic sprouts in the post-natal mouse retina. Because of its broad multicontextual and multiphylletic distribution, understanding cell migration in its various manifestations in vivo is likely to provide new insights into both the function and malfunction of key embryonic and postembryonic events. In this review, we will provide a succinct phenotypic description of the many model systems utilized to study cell migration in vivo. More importantly, we will highlight, compare and integrate recent advances in our understanding of how cell migration is regulated in these varied model systems with special emphasis on individual and collective cell movements. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen intermediates, i.e. the superoxide radical (O2.-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the hydroxyl radical (.OH), are generally regarded as harmful products of oxygenic metabolism causing cell damage in plants, animals and microorganisms. However, oxygen radical chemistry may also play a useful role in polymer breakdown leading to wall loosening during extension growth of plant cells controlled by the phytohormone auxin. Backbone cleavage of cell wall polysaccharides can be accomplished in vitro by .OH produced from H2O2 in a Fenton reaction or in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase supplied with O2 and NADH. Here, we show that coleoptile growth of maize seedlings is accompanied by the release of reactive oxygen intermediates in the cell wall. Auxin promotes release of O2.- and subsequent generation of .OH when inducing elongation growth. Experimental generation of .OH in the wall causes an increase in wall extensibility in vitro and replaces auxin in inducing growth. Auxin-induced growth can be inhibited by scavengers of O2.-, H2O2 or .OH, or inhibitors interfering with the formation of these molecules in the cell wall. These results provide the experimental background for a novel hypothesis on the mechanism of plant cell growth in which .OH, produced from O2.- and H2O2 by cell wall peroxidase, acts as a wall-loosening agent.},

Here, we report that the plasma membrane-localized transmembrane kinase (TMK) receptor-like kinases interact with ABP1 and transduce auxin signal to activate plasma membrane-associated ROPs [Rho-like guanosine triphosphatases (GTPase) from plants], leading to changes in the cytoskeleton and the shape of leaf pavement cells in Arabidopsis. The interaction between ABP1 and TMK at the cell surface is induced by auxin and requires ABP1 sensing of auxin.

abstract = {Shape is an indicator of cell health. But how is the information in shape decoded? We hypothesize that decoding occurs by modulation of signaling through changes in plasma membrane curvature. Using analytical approaches and numerical simulations, we studied how elongation of cell shape affects plasma membrane signaling. Mathematical analyses reveal transient accumulation of activated receptors at regions of higher curvature with increasing cell eccentricity. This distribution of activated receptors is periodic, following the Mathieu function, and it arises from local imbalance between reaction and diffusion of soluble ligands and receptors in the plane of the membrane. Numerical simulations show that transient microdomains of activated receptors amplify signals to downstream protein kinases. For growth factor receptor pathways, increasing cell eccentricity elevates the levels of activated cytoplasmic Src and nuclear MAPK1,2. These predictions were experimentally validated by changing cellular eccentricity, showing that shape is a locus of retrievable information storage in cells. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Plants are able to generate large leaf surfaces that act as two-dimensional solar panels with a minimum investment in building material, thanks to a hydrostatic skeleton. This requires high intracellular pressures (up to 1 MPa), which depend on the presence of strong cell walls. The walls of growing cells (also called primary walls), are remarkably able to reconcile extreme tensile strength (up to 100 MPa) with the extensibility necessary for growth. All walled organisms are confronted with this dilemma — the need to balance strength and extensibility — and bacteria, fungi and plants have evolved independent solutions to cope. In this Primer, we discuss how plant cells have solved this problem, allowing them to support often very large increases in volume and to develop a broad variety of shapes (Figure 1A,B,D). This shape variation reflects the targeted deposition of wall material combined with local variations in cell-wall extensibility, processes that remain incompletely understood. Once the cell has reached its final size, it can lay down secondary wall layers, the composition and architecture of which are optimized to exert specific functions in different cell types (Figure 1E–G). Such functions include: providing mechanical support, for instance, for fibre cells in tree trunks or grass internodes; impermeabilising and strengthening vascular tissue to resist the negative pressure of the transpiration stream; increasing the surface area of the plasma membrane to facilitate solute exchange between cells (Figure 1C); or allowing important elastic deformation, for instance, to support the opening and closing of stomates. Specialized secondary walls, such as those constituting seed mucilage, are stored in a dehydrated form in seedcoat epidermis cells and show rapid swelling upon hydration of the seed. Other walls, in particular in reserve tissues, can accommodate large amounts of storage polysaccharides, which can be easily mobilized as a carbon source. Here we will discuss some general principles underlying wall architecture and wall growth that have emerged from recent studies, as well as future questions for investigation (Box 1).},

Focusing on multicellular organs, I survey the occurrence of expansion anisotropy and discuss its causes and proposed controls. Expansion anisotropy of a unit area of cell wall is characterized by the direction and degree of anisotropy. The direction of maximal expansion rate is usually regulated by the direction of net alignment among cellulose microfibrils, which overcomes the prevailing stress anisotropy. In some stems, the directionality of expansion of epidermal cells is controlled by that of the inner tissue. The degree of anisotropy can vary widely as a function of position and of treatment. The degree of anisotropy is probably controlled by factors in addition to the direction of microfibril alignment. I hypothesize that rates of expansion in maximal and minimal directions are regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms that regulate interactions between matrix and microfibrils.},

abstract = {The process of oriented divisions of polarised cells is a recurrent mechanism of cell fate diversification in development. It is commonly assumed that a specialised mechanism of spindle alignment into the axis of polarity is a prerequisite for such systems to generate cell fate diversity. Oriented divisions also take place in the frog blastula, where orientation of the spindle into the apicobasal axis of polarised blastomeres generates inner and outer cells with different fates. Here, we show that, in this system, the spindle orients according to the shape of the cells, a mechanism often thought to be a default. We show that in the embryo, fate-differentiative, perpendicular divisions correlate with a perpendicular long axis and a small apical surface, but the long axis rather then the size of the apical domain defines the division orientation. Mitotic spindles in rounded, yet polarised, isolated Xenopus blastula cells orient randomly, but align into an experimentally introduced long axis when cells are deformed early in the cell cycle. Unlike other systems of oriented divisions, the spindle aligns at prophase, rotation behaviour is rare and restricted to small angle adjustments. Disruption of astral microtubules leads to misalignment of the spindle. These results show that a mechanism of spindle orientation that depends on cell shape rather than cortical polarity can nevertheless generate cell fate diversity from a population of polarised cells.},

We show that the fast, early phase of GBE depends on cell shape change in addition to cell intercalation. In antero-posterior patterning mutants such as those for the gap gene Kr{\"{u}}ppel, defective polarized cell intercalation is compensated for by an increase in antero-posterior cell elongation, such that the initial rate of extension remains the same. Spatio-temporal patterns of cell behaviours indicate that an antero-posterior tensile force deforms the germ band, causing the cells to change shape passively. The rate of antero-posterior cell elongation is reduced in twist mutant embryos, which lack mesoderm. We propose that cell shape change contributing to germ-band extension is a passive response to mechanical forces caused by the invaginating mesoderm.},

Their presence generates a paracellular barrier, analogous to animal tight junctions, that is thought to be crucial for selective nutrient uptake, exclusion of pathogens, and many other processes. Despite their importance, the chemical nature of Casparian strips has remained a matter of debate, confounding further molecular analysis. Suberin, lignin, lignin-like polymers, or both, have been claimed to make up Casparian strips. Here we show that, in Arabidopsis, suberin is produced much too late to take part in Casparian strip formation. In addition, we have generated plants devoid of any detectable suberin, which still establish functional Casparian strips. In contrast, manipulating lignin biosynthesis abrogates Casparian strip formation. Finally, monolignol feeding and lignin-specific chemical analysis indicates the presence of archetypal lignin in Casparian strips. Our findings establish the chemical nature of the primary root-diffusion barrier in Arabidopsis and enable a mechanistic dissection of the formation of Casparian strips, which are an independent way of generating tight junctions in eukaryotes.},

Cell dimensions of the apical cell were related to the length/width ratios associated with minimal area in the transverse plane vs. longitudinal plane, by modeling the apical cell as a hemisphere subtended by a cylinder. Our working hypothesis predicts that filamentous growth is perpetuated by an apical cell geometry that makes the transverse division plane the orientation of minimal surface area, whereas the transition to two-dimensional growth (longitudinal division of the apical cell) occurs once the longitudinal plane becomes the position of minimal surface area. The predictions of this hypothesis are fulfilled regardless of variations in light intensity and light quality, the presence of regulators of metabolism, or whether the experimental perturbation causes a corresponding selective inhibition of the transition to two-dimensional growth. Thus, the control of the plane of cell division in this system seems to depend on thermodynamic considerations of surface area. Furthermore, we favor the conclusion that the role of the genome in the transition to two-dimensional growth involves its influence on apical cell dimensions rather than the induction of specific genes for specific morphogenetic mRNAs.},

We show that surprisingly, inhibition of RAB-A5c function is associated with increased CMT/CMF anisotropy. We present genetic, pharmacological, and modelling evidence that this increase in CMT/CMF anisotropy partially compensates for loss of an independent RAB-A5c-mediated mechanism that maintains anisotropic growth in meristematic cells. We show that RAB-A5c associates with CMTs at cell edges, indicating that CMTs act as an integration point for both mechanisms controlling cellular growth anisotropy in lateral roots.},

The formation of complex leaf shape through the use of PCD is a rare event across vascular plants and occurs only in a few species of Monstera and related genera, and in the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis). During early development, the lace plant leaf forms a pattern of equidistantly positioned perforations across the surface of the leaf, giving it a lattice-like appearance. Due to the accessibility and predictability of this process, the lace plant provides highly suitable material for the study of developmentally regulated PCD in plants. A sterile lace plant culture system has been successfully established, providing material free of micro-organisms for experimental study. The potential role of ethylene and caspase-like activity in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant is currently under investigation, with preliminary results indicating that both may play a role in the cell death pathway. {\textcopyright} The Author [2007].

abstract = {Plant morphogenesis depends on the synchronized anisotropic expansion of individual cells in response to developmental and environmental cues. The magnitude of cell expansion depends on the biomechanical properties of the cell wall, which in turn depends on both its biosynthesis and extensibility. Although the control of cell expansion by the phytohormone auxin is well established, its regulation of cell wall composition, traffcking of H+-ATPases, and K+ influx that drives growth is still being elucidated. Furthermore, the maintenance of auxin fluxes via the interaction between the cytoskeleton and PIN protein recycling on the plasma membrane remains under investigation. This review proposes a model that describes how the cell wall, auxin, microtubule binding-protein CLASP and Kin7/separase complexes, and vesicle traffcking are co-ordinated on a cellular level to mediate cell wall loosening during cell expansion.},

Cell shape changes and tissue movements like these are at the core of many of the morphogenetic movements that shape animal form during development, driving processes such as gastrulation, tube formation, and neurulation. The mechanisms of such cell shape changes must integrate developmental patterning information in order to spatially and temporally control force production-issues that touch on fundamental aspects of both cell and developmental biology and on birth defects research. How does developmental patterning regulate force-producing mechanisms, and what roles do such mechanisms play in development? Work on apical constriction from multiple systems including Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, sea urchin, Xenopus, chick, and mouse has begun to illuminate these issues. Here, we review this effort to explore the diversity of mechanisms of apical constriction, the diversity of roles that apical constriction plays in development, and the common themes that emerge from comparing systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we use postembryonic development in Arabidopsis plants to investigate the genetic control of growth. We demonstrate that gene expression driving the production of the growth-stimulating hormone gibberellic acid and downstream growth factors is first induced within the radicle tip of the embryo. The center of cell expansion is, however, spatially displaced from the center of gene expression. Because the rapidly growing cells have very different geometry from that of those at the tip, we hypothesized that mechanical factors may contribute to this growth displacement. To this end we developed 3D finite-element method models of growing custom-designed digital embryos at cellular resolution. We used this framework to conceptualize how cell size, shape, and topology influence tissue growth and to explore the interplay of geometrical and genetic inputs into growth distribution. Our simulations showed that mechanical constraints are sufficient to explain the disconnect between the experimentally observed spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and early post-embryonic growth. The center of cell expansion is the position where genetic and mechanical facilitators of growth converge. We have thus uncovered a mechanism whereby 3D cellular geometry helps direct where genetically specified growth takes place.},

abstract = {Current interest in pattern formation can be traced to a seminal paper by Turing, who demonstrated that a system of reacting and diffusing chemicals, called morphogens, can interact so as to produce stable nonuniform concentration patterns in space. Recently, a Turing model has been suggested to explain the development of pigmentation patterns on species of growing angelfish such as Pomacanthus semicirculatus, which exhibit readily observed changes in the number, size, and orientation of colored stripes during development of juvenile and adult stages, but the model fails to predict key features of the observations on stripe formation. Here we develop a generalized Turing model incorporating cell growth and movement, we analyze the effects of these processes on patterning, and we demonstrate that the model can explain important features of pattern formation in a growing system such as Pomacanthus. The applicability of classical Turing models to biological pattern formation is limited by virtue of the sensitivity of patterns to model parameters, but here we show that the incorporation of growth results in robustly generated patterns without strict parameter control. In the model, chemotaxis in response to gradients in a morphogen distribution leads to aggregation of one type of pigment cell into a striped spatial pattern.},

Pollen tubes and root hairs are model cell systems for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying sustained tip growth. The formation of intercalated epidermal pavement cells requires excitatory and inhibitory pathways to coordinate cell expansion within single cells and between cells in contact. Strictly controlled cell expansion is linked to asymmetric cell division in zygotes and stomatal lineages, which require integrated processes of pre-mitotic cellular polarization and division asymmetry. While small GTPase ROPs are recognized as fundamental signaling switches for cell polarity in various cellular and developmental processes in plants, the broader molecular machinery underpinning polarity establishment required for asymmetric division remains largely unknown. Here, we review the widely used ROP signaling pathways in cell polar growth and the recently discovered feedback loops with auxin signaling and PIN effluxers. We discuss the conserved phosphorylation and phospholipid signaling mechanisms for regulating uneven distribution of proteins, as well as the potential roles of novel proteins and MAPKs in the polarity establishment related to asymmetric cell division in plants.},

Root hairs, tubular-shaped outgrowths of specific epidermal cells, significantly increase the root's surface area and aid in these processes. In this review we focus on the molecular mechanisms that determine the hair and non-hair cell fate of epidermal cells and that define the site on the epidermal cell where the root hair will be initiated (=planar polarity determination). In the model plant Arabidopsis, trichoblast and atrichoblast cell fate results from intra- and intercellular position-dependent signaling and from complex feedback loops that ultimately regulate GL2 expressing and non-expressing cells. When epidermal cells reach the end of the root expansion zone, root hair promoting transcription factors dictate the establishment of polarity within epidermal cells followed by the selection of the root hair initiation site at the more basal part of the trichoblast. Molecular players in the abovementioned processes as well as the role of phytohormones are discussed, and open areas for future experiments are identified.},

Auxin regulates transcription by rapidly modulating levels of Aux/IAA proteins throughout development. Recent studies demonstrate that auxin perception occurs through a novel mechanism. Auxin binds to TIR1, the F-box subunit of the ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(TIR1), and stabilizes the interaction between TIR1 and Aux/IAA substrates. This interaction results in Aux/IAA ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Regulation of the Aux/IAA protein family by TIR1 and TIR1-like auxin receptors (AFBs) links auxin action to transcriptional regulation and provides a model by which the vast array of auxin influences on development may be understood. Moreover, auxin receptor function is the first example of small-molecule regulation of an SCF ubiquitin ligase and may have important implications for studies of regulated protein degradation in other species, including animals.},

In plants, as in animals, asymmetric divisions are correlated with the production of cellular diversity and pattern; however, structural constraints imposed by plant cell walls and the absence of homologs of known animal or fungal cell polarity regulators necessitates that plants utilize new molecules and mechanisms to create asymmetries. Here, we identify BASL, a novel regulator of asymmetric divisions in Arabidopsis. In asymmetrically dividing stomatal-lineage cells, BASL accumulates in a polarized crescent at the cell periphery before division, and then localizes differentially to the nucleus and a peripheral crescent in self-renewing cells and their sisters after division. BASL presence at the cell periphery is critical for its function, and we propose that BASL represents a plant-specific solution to the challenge of asymmetric cell division. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Plants use specialized carrier proteins to transport the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to target tissues. To date, efflux carrier-mediated polar auxin transport has been assumed to represent the sole mode of long distance IAA movement. Localization of the auxin permease AUX1 in the Arabidopsis root apex has revealed a novel phloem-based IAA transport pathway. AUX1, asymmetrically localized to the plasma membrane of root protophloem cells, is proposed to promote the acropetal, post-phloem movement of auxin to the root apex. MS analysis shows that IAA accumulation in aux1 mutant root apices is impaired, consistent with an AUX1 phloem unloading function. AUX1 localization to columella and lateral root cap tissues of the Arabidopsis root apex reveals that the auxin permease regulates a second IAA transport pathway. Expression studies using an auxin-regulated reporter suggest that AUX1 is necessary for root gravitropism by facilitating basipetal auxin transport to distal elongation zone tissues.},

abstract = {Endosomal trafficking plays an integral role in various eukaryotic cell activities and serves as a basis for higher-order functions in multicellular organisms. An understanding of the importance of endosomal trafficking in plants is rapidly developing, but its molecular mechanism is mostly unknown. Several key regulators of endosomal trafficking, including RAB5, which regulates diverse endocytic events in animal cells, are highly conserved. However, the identification of lineage-specific regulators in eukaryotes indicates that endosomal trafficking is diversified according to distinct body plans and lifestyles. In addition to orthologues of metazoan RAB5, land plants possess a unique RAB5 molecule, which is one of the most prominent features of plant RAB GTPase organization. Plants have also evolved a unique repertoire of SNAREs, the most distinctive of which are diverse VAMP7-related longins, including plant-unique VAMP72 derivatives. Here, we demonstrate that a plant-unique RAB5 protein, ARA6, acts in an endosomal trafficking pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. ARA6 modulates the assembly of a distinct SNARE complex from conventional RAB5, and has a functional role in the salinity stress response. Our results indicate that plants possess a unique endosomal trafficking network and provide the first indication of a functional link between a specific RAB and a specific SNARE complex in{\^{A}} plants. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The periodic formation of plant organs such as leaves and flowers gives rise to intricate patterns that have fascinated biologists and mathematicians alike for hundreds of years [1]. The plant hormone auxin plays a central role in establishing these patterns by promoting organ formation at sites where it accumulates due to its polar, cell-to-cell transport [2–6]. Although experimental evidence as well as modeling suggest that feedback from auxin to its transport direction may help specify phyllotactic patterns [7–12], the nature of this feedback remains unclear [13]. Here we reveal that polarization of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) is regulated by the auxin response transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) [14]. We find that in the shoot, cell polarity patterns follow MP expression, which in turn follows auxin distribution patterns. By perturbing MP activity both globally and locally, we show that localized MP activity is necessary for the generation of polarity convergence patterns and that localized MP expression is sufficient to instruct PIN1 polarity directions non-cell autonomously, toward MP-expressing cells. By expressing MP in the epidermis of mp mutants, we further show that although MP activity in a single-cell layer is sufficient to promote polarity convergence patterns, MP in sub-epidermal tissues helps anchor these polarity patterns to the underlying cells. Overall, our findings reveal a patterning module in plants that determines organ position by orienting transport of the hormone auxin toward cells with high levels of MP-mediated auxin signaling. We propose that this feedback process acts broadly to generate periodic plant architectures.},

abstract = {To investigate the spatial relationship between the nucleus and the cortical division site, epidermal cells were selected in which the separation between these two areas is large. Avoiding enzyme treatment and air drying, Datura stramonium cells were labeled with antitubulin antibodies and the three-dimensional aspect of the cytoskeletons was reconstructed using computer-aided optical sectioning. In vacuolated cells preparing for division, the nucleus migrates into the center of the cell, suspended by transvacuolar strands. These strands are now shown to contain continuous bundles of microtubules which bridge the nucleus to the cortex. These nucleus-radiating microtubules adopt different configurations in cells of different shape. In elongated cells with more or less parallel side walls, oblique strands radiating from the nucleus to the long side walls are presumably unstable, for they are progressively realigned into a transverse disc (the phragmosome) as broad, cortical, preprophase bands (PPBs) become tighter. The phragmosome and the PPB are both known predictors of the division plane and our observations indicate that they align simultaneously in elongated epidermal cells. These observations suggest another hypothesis: that the PPB may contain microtubules polymerized from the nuclear surface. In elongated cells, the majority of the radiating microtubules, therefore, come to anchor the nucleus in the transverse plane, consistent with the observed tendency of such cells to divide perpendicular to the long axis. In nonrectangular isodiametric epidermal cells, which approximate regular hexagons in section, the radial microtubular strands emanating from the nucleus tend to remain associated with the middle of each subtending cell wall. The strands are not reorganized into a single dominant transverse bar, but remain as a starlike array until mitosis. PPBs in these cells are not as tight; they may only be a sparse accumulation of microtubules, even forming along non-diametrical radii. This arrangement is consistent with the irregular division patterns observed in epidermal mosaics of isodiametric D. stramonium cells. The various conformations of the radial strands can be modeled by springs held in two-dimensional hexagonal frames, and by soap bubbles in three-dimensional hexagonal frames, suggesting that the division plane may, by analogy, be selected by minimal path criteria. Such behavior offers a cytoplasmic explanation of long-standing empirically derived "rules" which state that the new cell wall tends to meet the maternal wall at right angles. The radial premitotic strands and their analogues avoid taking the longer path to the vertex of an angle where a cross wall is already present between neighboring cells. The resultant tendency to form three-rayed vertices rather than intercrossing septa helps explain the hexagonal packing of plant cells.},
