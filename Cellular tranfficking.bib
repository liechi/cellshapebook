abstract = {Endocytosis marks the entry of internalized receptors into the complex network of endocytic trafficking pathways. Endocytic vesicles are rapidly targeted to a distinct membrane-bound endocytic organelle referred to as the early endosome. Despite the existence of numerous internalization routes, early endosomes (EE) serve as a focal point of the endocytic pathway. Sorting events initiated at this compartment determine the subsequent fate of internalized proteins and lipids, destining them either for recycling to the plasma membrane, degradation in lysosomes or delivery to the trans-Golgi network. Sorting of endocytic cargo to the latter compartments is accomplished through the formation of distinct microdomains within early endosomes, through the coordinate recruitment and assembly of the sorting machinery. An elaborate network of interactions between endocytic regulatory proteins ensures synchronized sorting of cargo to microdomains followed by morphological changes at the early endosomal membranes. Consequently, the cargo targeted either for recycling back to the plasma membrane, or for retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network, localizes to newly-formed tubular membranes. With a high ratio of membrane surface to lumenal volume, these tubules effectively concentrate the recycling cargo, ensuring efficient transport out of the EE. Conversely, receptors sorted for degradation cluster at the flat clathrin lattices involved in invaginations of the limiting membrane, associating with newly formed intralumenal vesicles. In this review we will discuss the characteristics of early endosomes, their role in the regulation of endocytic transport, and their aberrant function in a variety of diseases.},

abstract = {Summary The membrane trafficking system is responsible for precise transportation and localization of proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides among single membrane-bound organelles, the plasma membrane, and the extracellular space. While the exocytic trafficking pathway is considered to be a default transport pathway in many organisms, including land plants, research has shown that evolutionary processes led to an increase in the number of machinery components involved in the plant exocytic pathway. This study provides an overview of the diversification of exocytic trafficking pathways in plants, which mediate the formation and maintenance of cell polarity, interaction with symbiotic and pathogenic microbes, and cytokinesis. To fulfill these functions, distinct strategies have been employed to reroute secretory/exocytic transport during land plant evolution.},

@article{Louveaux2016,
abstract = {Cell geometry has long been proposed to play a key role in the orientation of symmetric cell division planes. In particular, the recently proposed Besson-Dumais rule generalizes Errera's rule and predicts that cells divide along one of the local minima of plane area. However, this rule has been tested only on tissues with rather local spherical shape and homogeneous growth. Here, we tested the application of the Besson-Dumais rule to the divisions occurring in the Arabidopsis shoot apex, which contains domains with anisotropic curvature and differential growth. We found that the Besson-Dumais rule works well in the central part of the apex, but fails to account for cell division planes in the saddle-shaped boundary region. Because curvature anisotropy and differential growth prescribe directional tensile stress in that region, we tested the putative contribution of anisotropic stress fields to cell division plane orientation at the shoot apex. To do so, we compared two division rules: geometrical (new plane along the shortest path) and mechanical (new plane along maximal tension). The mechanical division rule reproduced the enrichment of long planes observed in the boundary region. Experimental perturbation of mechanical stress pattern further supported a contribution of an-isotropic tensile stress in division plane orientation. Importantly, simulations of tissues growing in an isotropic stress field, and dividing along maximal tension, provided division plane distributions comparable to those obtained with the geometrical rule. We thus propose that division plane orientation by tensile stress offers a general rule for symmetric cell division in plants. cell division plane | mechanical forces | meristem | vertex model | Arabidopsis R egulation of cell division plane orientation is a way for multicellular organisms to control the topology (number of adjacent cells) and geometry (cell shapes and sizes) of their tissues , as illustrated in simulations of growing tissue under different division rules (for instance, ref. 1). Whereas this process may be compensated by cell death and cell rearrangement in animal tissues, such compensation may occur only through subsequent growth patterns in plants: Plant cells are glued to each other by stiff pectocellulosic cell walls, which prevent cell movement , and cell death usually does not occur in young, rapidly dividing tissues. Mechanically, the creation of a new cell wall also leads to the local reinforcement of the tissue in a preferential direction. Altogether, this raises the question of the cues that help in controlling cell division plane orientation in plants. At the end of the 19th century, Hofmeister (2), Sachs (3), and Errera (4) proposed that cell division plane orientation in symmetric divisions only relies on cell geometry. In particular, L{\'{e}}o Errera originally observed that cells behave like soap bubbles when positioning their division plane; i.e., they tend to minimize the area of the new interface between the two daughter cells. From this statement was derived the now famous Errera's rule, "cells divide along the shortest path," which is a rough simplification of Errera's initial observation (for a full review, see ref. 5). Errera's rule was able to recapitulate the development of a simple organism like Coleochaete orbicularis, albeit with some level of noise (6). These geometric rules were also tested in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem (SAM), a dome-shaped group of dividing cells that generates every aerial organ. Although Errera's rule described the highest percentage of divisions, neither Hofmeister's, nor Errera's, nor Sachs' rules fully described all of the divisions at the SAM (7). Recently, Errera's original statement was elegantly reexamined through an analogy with soap bubbles: Cells do not always divide along the shortest path, but instead divide along one of the shortest paths (5). Indeed, for a given cell geometry, several minima of path length exist and the probability to divide along one of these minima is related to the area of the interface between the two daughter cells. Based on these observations, the deterministic "shortest path" rule was generalized to a probabi-listic one, referred to here as the Besson-Dumais rule (8). The proposed molecular mechanism behind the Besson-Dumais rule involves the perception of geometry-derived cues and their integration via the organization of cytoplasmic micro-tubules (8). Interestingly, ablation experiments and analog models suggest that cytoplasmic strands, populated with microtubules, are under tension (9, 10). These strands would guide the relocation of the nucleus at the cell center of mass before division and coalesce into the phragmosome at the future division site. Tension could reinforce selection of the shortest path (8). Consistently, the application of mechanical perturbations to plant tissues or cells can affect the next division plane orientation, although with sometimes contradictory results (11-13). There is also indirect evidence that tension may play a role in division plane orientation: Before cell division, cortical micro-tubules reorganize in a ring called the preprophase band (PPB), which determines the position of the new cell wall (14). There is now accumulating evidence that cortical microtubules align along maximal tensile stress in cell walls, whether stress is subcellular or supracellular (15, 16). Therefore, cortical microtubules may serve as intermediates between tension patterns in cell walls and cell division plane orientation. In the most general scenario, such tensile stress may be prescribed not only by cell geometry but Significance The control of cell division plane orientation is crucial in biology and most particularly in plants, in which cells cannot rearrange their positions, as they are glued to each other by their cell walls. Cell geometry has long been proposed to determine cell division plane orientation. Here, using statistical analysis, modeling, and live imaging in the Arabidopsis shoot apex, we show that plant cells instead divide along maximal tension.},

The importance of regulated secretory and endocytic trafficking is becoming increasingly clear; however, our knowledge of the compartments and molecular machinery involved is still fragmentary. We used immunogold electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy to trace the route of cargo molecules, including the BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 receptor and the REQUIRES HIGH BORON1 boron exporter, throughout the plant endomembrane system. Our results provide evidence that both endocytic and secretory cargo pass through the trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) and demonstrate that cargo in late endosomes/multivesicular bodies is destined for vacuolar degradation. Moreover, using spinning disc microscopy, we show that TGN/EEs move independently and are only transiently associated with an individual Golgi stack.},

abstract = {Endocytosis and endosomal trafficking are essential processes in cells that control the dynamics and turnover of plasma membrane proteins, such as receptors , transporters, and cell wall biosynthetic enzymes. Plasma membrane proteins (cargo) are internalized by endocytosis through clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent mechanism and delivered to early endosomes. From the endosomes, cargo proteins are recycled back to the plasma membrane via different pathways, which rely on small GTPases and the retromer complex. Proteins that are targeted for degradation through ubiquitination are sorted into endosomal vesicles by the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery for degradation in the vacuole. Endo-cytic and endosomal trafficking regulates many cellular, developmental, and physiological processes, including cellular polarization, hormone transport, metal ion homeostasis, cytokinesis, pathogen responses, and development. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that mediate the recognition and sorting of endocytic and endosomal cargos, the vesiculation processes that mediate their trafficking, and their connection to cellular and physiological responses in plants.},

@article{Besnard2014,
abstract = {How biological systems generate reproducible patterns with high precision is a central question in science 1. The shoot apical meristem (SAM), a specialized tissue producing plant aerial organs, is a developmental system of choice to address this question. Organs are periodically initiated at the SAM at specific spatial positions and this spatiotemporal pattern defines phyllotaxis. Accumulation of the plant hormone auxin triggers organ initiation 2-5 , whereas auxin depletion around organs generates inhibitory fields that are thought to be sufficient to maintain these patterns and their dynamics 4,6-13. Here we show that another type of hormone-based inhibitory fields, generated directly downstream of auxin by intercellular movement of the cytokinin signalling inhibitor ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN 6 (AHP6) 14 , is involved in regulating phyllotactic patterns. We demonstrate that AHP6-based fields establish patterns of cytokinin signalling in the meristem that contribute to the robustness of phyllotaxis by imposing a temporal sequence on organ initiation. Our findings indicate that not one but two distinct hormone-based fields may be required for achieving temporal precision during formation of reiterative structures at the SAM, thus indicating an original mechanism for providing robustness to a dynamic developmental system. In the most widely accepted theory for phyllotaxis, spatiotemporal patterns of organ initiation at the SAM result from the combined effect of inhibitory fields produced by existing organs. As these organs are displaced away from the SAM by growth, new organs form sequentially at positions where the sum of the inhibitory effects is the lowest 6-8. Both the position of new organs and the time delay between organ initiations (or plastochron) are emergent parameters of this dynamical system 8. Strong evidence indicates that, notably through a network of polarly localized PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) efflux carriers, polar auxin transport not only controls accumulation of auxin at the site of organ initiation but also creates inhibitory fields around organs by auxin depletion 4,9-13. It has therefore been proposed that the auxin transport system could be sufficient to control both the spatial and the temporal dynamics of phyllotaxis 4. Here we re-evaluated this proposition by considering the role of cytokinin during organ initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Cytokinin regulates the size of the stem cell niche (and thus of the SAM) and this can effect phyllotaxis by modifying the geometry of the SAM 15,16. To explore a possible role of cytokinin directly in organ initiation, we re-analysed recent transcriptomic data for different domains of the SAM 17 and identified AHP6 (ref. 14) as the only candidate gene encoding a cytokinin signalling effector specifically enriched in organs (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2a). Using in situ hybridization, we confirmed that AHP6 is specifically expressed during organ initiation and development (Fig. 1b, c, Supplementary Fig. 2b-h) 18. Wild-type Arabidopsis plants display spiral phyllotaxis, resulting in consecutive organs generally distributed on the stem at a divergence angle close to a 137.5u cano-nical angle (noted as a; Fig. 1d). In contrast, both ahp6-1 and ahp6-3 null mutants as well as the ahp6-1/ahp6-3 (ahp6-1/3) trans-heterozygote showed obvious modifications in organ arrangements along the stem (Fig. 1e-g). We also observed supernumerary petals and sepals in flowers (Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that AHP6 regulates phyllotaxis throughout inflorescence development. To further characterize the stem architecture of ahp6 mutants, we analysed sequences of successive divergence angles between organs on the inflorescence stems from a large population of ahp6-1 and wild-type plants. This analysis demonstrated a notable amount of non-canonical divergence angles in wild-type plants and a large increase in the occurrence of such angles in most mutants (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Notably , an 'M-shaped' motif corresponding approximately to the angle sequence 2a, 3602a, 2a appeared much more frequently in ahp6 than in wild-type sequences (Fig. 1h, i and Supplementary Fig. 4c-f). It was not associated with changes in the structure of the stem, such as twisting , that could modify angles between siliques (Supplementary Fig. 5). This motif can theoretically arise if two consecutive organs in a canonical sequence are permuted along the stem (Fig. 1j) 19. By applying a stochastic and a combinatorial model to analyse the divergence angle sequences (see Methods), we showed that over 95{\%} of the non-canonical angles can indeed be explained by permutations of the insertion order of 2 to 3 organs in both wild-type and ahp6 plants (Fig. 1k, l and Supplementary Fig. 4c-f). We further demonstrated an increase by 2.4-fold and 17.6-fold of permutations involving 2 and 3 organs, respectively, in ahp6 mutants compared to wild-type plants (Fig. 1k). Altogether, our data indicate that AHP6 is required for buffering an intrinsic instability of phyllotaxis leading to permutations in the order of organ insertions along the stem. We next used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study the geometry of the ahp6 mutant SAM. In wild-type meristems the spatial organization of the organs usually followed the expected phyllotaxis and consecutive organs showed clear differences in size (Fig. 2a). In contrast, pairs or triplets of young organs at quasi-identical developmental stages occurred in most ahp6 meristems (Fig. 2b). This observation was confirmed using a LEAFY (LFY) promoter driving GFP (pLFY::GFP) flower-specific marker line (Fig. 2c, d), demonstrating that the loss of AHP6 leads to simultaneous development of flowers instead of the mostly sequential outgrowth observed in wild-type meristems. As the size of the stem-cell niche and of the meristem were not significantly affected by the ahp6 mutation (Supplementary Fig. 6), these data indicate that AHP6 is required for regulating the sequence of organ},

abstract = {Acyl chain length is thought to be crucial for biophysical properties of the membrane, in particular during cell division, when active vesicular fusion is necessary. In higher plants, the process of cytokinesis is unique, because the separation of the two daughter cells is carried out by de novo vesicular fusion to generate a laterally expanding cell plate. In Arabidopsis thaliana, very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) depletion caused by a mutation in the microsomal elongase gene PASTICCINO2 (PAS2) or by application of the selective elongase inhibitor flufenacet altered cytokinesis. Cell plate expansion was delayed and the formation of the endomembrane tubular network altered. These defects were associated with specific aggregation of the cell plate markers YFP-Rab-A2a and KNOLLE during cytokinesis. Changes in levels of VLCFA also resulted in modification of endocytosis and sensitivity to brefeldin A. Finally, the cytokinesis impairment in pas2 cells was associated with reduced levels of very long fatty acyl chains in phospholipids. Together, our findings demonstrate that VLCFA-containing lipids are essential for endomembrane dynamics during cytokinesis.},

abstract = {The plant trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) is a major hub for secretory and endocytic trafficking with complex molecular mechanisms controlling sorting and transport of cargo. Vacuolar transport from the TGN/EE to multivesicular bodies/late endosomes (MVBs/LEs) is assumed to occur via clathrin-coated vesicles, although direct proof for their participation is missing. Here, we present evidence that post-TGN transport toward lytic vacuoles occurs independently of clathrin and that MVBs/LEs are derived from the TGN/EE through maturation. We show that the V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A significantly reduces the number of MVBs and causes TGN and MVB markers to colocalize in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Ultrastructural analysis reveals the formation of MVBs from the TGN/EE and their fusion with the vacuole. The localization of the ESCRT components VPS28, VPS22, and VPS2 at the TGN/EE and MVBs/LEs indicates that the formation of intraluminal vesicles starts already at the TGN/EE. Accordingly, a dominant-negative mutant of VPS2 causes TGN and MVB markers to colocalize and blocks vacuolar transport. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the annexin ANNAT3 also yields the same phenotype. Together, these data indicate that MVBs originate from the TGN/EE in a process that requires the action of ESCRT for the formation of intraluminal vesicles and annexins for the final step of releasing MVBs as a transport carrier to the vacuole.},

In plant cytokinesis, post-Golgi trafficking mediates a massive flow of vesicles that form the partitioning membrane but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify functionally redundant Arabidopsis ARF guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs) BIG1-BIG4 as regulators of post-Golgi trafficking, mediating late secretion from the trans-Golgi network but not recycling of endocytosed proteins to the plasma membrane, although the TGN also functions as an early endosome in plants. In contrast, BIG1-4 are absolutely required for trafficking of both endocytosed and newly synthesized proteins to the cell-division plane during cytokinesis, counteracting recycling to the plasma membrane. This change from recycling to secretory trafficking pathway mediated by ARF-GEFs confers specificity of cargo delivery to the division plane and might thus ensure that the partitioning membrane is completed on time in the absence of a cytokinesis-interphase checkpoint.},

We found that STM expression is quantitatively correlated to curvature in the saddle-shaped boundary domain of the shoot apical meristem. As tissue folding reflects the presence of mechanical stress, we test and demonstrate that STM expression is induced after micromechanical perturbations. We also show that STM expression in the boundary domain is required for organ separation.

@article{Goss2012,
abstract = {In seed plants, different groups of orthologous genes encode the CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) proteins that are responsible for cellulose biosynthesis in primary and secondary cell walls. The seven CESA sequences of the moss Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) B. S. G. form a monophyletic sister group to seed plant CESAs, consistent with independent CESA diversification and specialization in moss and seed plant lines. The role of PpCESA5 in the development of P. patens was investigated by targeted mutagenesis. The cesa5 knockout lines were tested for cellulose deficiency using carbohydrate-binding module affinity cytochemistry and the morphology of the leafy gametophores was analyzed by 3D reconstruction of confocal images. No defects were identified in the development of the filamentous protonema or in production of bud initials that normally give rise to the leafy gametophores. However, the gametophore buds were cellulose deficient and defects in subsequent cell expansion, cytokinesis, and leaf initiation resulted in the formation of irregular cell clumps instead of leafy shoots. Analysis of the cesa5 knockout phenotype indicates that a biophysical model of organogenesis can be extended to the moss gametophore shoot apical meristem.},

@article{PhaneVerger,
abstract = {Mechanical forces have emerged as coordinating signals for most cell functions. Yet, because forces are invisible, mapping tensile stress patterns in tissues remains a major challenge in all kingdoms. Here we take advantage of the adhesion defects in the Arabidopsis mutant quasimodo1 (qua1) to deduce stress patterns in tissues. By reducing the water potential and epidermal tension in planta, we rescued the adhesion defects in qua1, formally associating gaping and tensile stress patterns in the mutant. Using suboptimal water potential conditions, we revealed the relative contributions of shape-and growth-derived stress in prescribing maximal tension directions in aerial tissues. Consistently, the tension patterns deduced from the gaping patterns in qua1 matched the pattern of cortical microtubules, which are thought to align with maximal tension, in wild-type organs. Conversely, loss of epidermis continuity in the qua1 mutant hampered supracellular microtubule alignments, revealing that coordination through tensile stress requires cell-cell adhesion.},

abstract = {Transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex is highly selective. As a general rule, such transport is limited to soluble and membrane-associated secretory proteins that have reached properly folded and assembled conformations. To secure the efficiency, fidelity, and control of this crucial transport step, cells use a combination of mechanisms. The mechanisms are based on selective retention of proteins in the ER to prevent uptake into transport vesicles, on selective capture of proteins in COPII carrier vesicles, on inclusion of proteins in these vesicles by default as part of fluid and membrane bulk flow, and on selective retrieval of proteins from postER compartments by retrograde vesicle transport.},

@article{Reichardt2007,
abstract = {During plant cytokinesis membrane vesicles are efficiently delivered to the cell-division plane, where they fuse with one another to form a laterally expanding cell plate [1, 2]. These membrane vesicles were generally believed to originate from Golgi stacks. Recently, however, it was proposed that endocytosis contributes substantially to cell-plate formation [3]. To determine the relative contributions of secretory and endocytic traffic to cytokinesis, we specifically inhibited either or both trafficking pathways in Arabidopsis. Blocking traffic to the division plane after the two pathways had converged at the trans-Golgi network disrupted cytokinesis and resulted in binucleate cells, whereas impairment of endocytosis alone did not interfere with cytokinesis. By contrast, inhibiting ER-Golgi traffic by eliminating the relevant BFA-resistant ARF-GEF [4] caused retention of newly synthesized proteins, such as the cytokinesis-specific syntaxin KNOLLE in the ER [5], and prevented the formation of the partitioning membrane. Our results suggest that during plant cytokinesis, unlike animal cytokinesis, protein secretion is absolutely essential, whereas endocytosis is not. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
