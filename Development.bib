abstract = {Biological shapes are often produced by the iterative generation of repeated units. The mechanistic basis of such iteration is an area of intense investigation. Leaf development in the model plant Ara-bidopsis is one such example where the repeated generation of leaf margin protrusions, termed serrations, is a key feature of final shape. However, the regulatory logic underlying this process is un-clear. Here, we use a combination of developmental genetics and computational modeling to show that serration development is the morphological read-out of a spatially distributed regulatory mech-anism, which creates interspersed activity peaks of the growth-pro-moting hormone auxin and the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) transcription factor. This mechanism operates at the growing leaf margin via a regulatory module consisting of two feedback loops working in concert. The first loop relates the transport of auxin to its own distribution, via polar membrane localization of the PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) efflux transporter. This loop captures the potential of auxin to generate self-organizing patterns in diverse develop-mental contexts. In the second loop, CUC2 promotes the generation of PIN1-dependent auxin activity maxima while auxin represses CUC2 expression. This CUC2-dependent loop regulates activity of the conserved auxin efflux module in leaf margins to generate stable serration patterns. Conceptualizing leaf margin develop-ment via this mechanism also helps to explain how other develop-mental regulators influence leaf shape. L eaf margin morphology is commonly used to distinguish dif-ferent plant species and often evolves in close correspon-dence with the environment. For example, the degree of leaf serration is a good predictor of mean annual temperature of landmasses over geological timescales (1). Variations in margin morphology were first documented in antiquity (2) and were among the first heritable traits studied in plants (3). Nonetheless, a predictive model of leaf margin shape acquisition is lacking. Recent genetic analyses have revealed two key processes re-quired for serration formation: regulated auxin transport by the efflux carrier PINFORMED1 (PIN1) (4) and activity of the growth repressor CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2), which is negatively regulated by miR164 (5). PIN1 has a polar subcellular localization and forms convergence points at the margins of leaves, creating localized auxin activity maxima that are required for the outgrowth of serrations (4, 6). Leaves of both pin1 and cuc2 mutants fail to initiate serrations and have smooth margins, highlighting the importance of these gene products for leaf morphogenesis (4, 5). Here, we show how CUC2 activity and auxin transport and signaling are regulated and integrated to sculpt leaf margin serrations. Results},

abstract = {Stem cells are formed at particular times and positions during the development of multicellular organisms. Whereas flowering plants form stem cells only in the sporophyte generation, non-seed plants form stem cells in both the sporophyte and gametophyte generations. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell formation in the sporophyte generation have been extensively studied, only a few transcription factors involved in the regulation of gametophyte stem cell formation have been reported. The moss Physcomitrella patens forms a hypha-like body (protonema) and a shoot-like body (gametophore) from a protonema apical cell and a gametophore apical cell, respectively. These apical cells have stem cell characteristics and are formed as side branches of differentiated protonema cells. Here, we show that four AP2-type transcription factors orthologous to Arabidopsis thaliana AINTEGUMENTA, PLETHORA and BABY BOOM (APB) are indispensable for the formation of gametophore apical cells from protonema cells. Quadruple disruption of all APB genes blocked gametophore formation, even in the presence of cytokinin, which enhances gametophore apical cell formation in the wild type. All APB genes were expressed in emerging gametophore apical cells, but not in protonema apical cells. Heat-shock induction of an APB4 transgene driven by a heat-shock promoter increased the number of gametophores. Expression of all APB genes was induced by auxin but not by cytokinin. Thus, the APB genes function synergistically with cytokinin signaling to determine the identity of the two types of stem cells. {\textcopyright} 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract = {Although genetic control of morphogenesis is well established, elaboration of complex shapes requires changes in the mechanical properties of cells. In plants, the first visible sign of leaf formation is a bulge on the flank of the shoot apical meristem. Bulging results from local relaxation of cell walls, which causes them to yield to internal hydrostatic pressure. By manipulation of tissue tension in combination with quantitative live imaging and finite-element modeling, we found that the slow-growing area at the shoot tip is substantially strain-stiffened compared with surrounding fast-growing tissue. We propose that strain stiffening limits growth, restricts organ bulging, and contributes to the meristem's functional zonation. Thus, mechanical signals are not just passive readouts of gene action but feed back on morphogenesis.},

abstract = {• The sequencing of the Physcomitrella patens genome, combined with the high frequency of gene targeting in this species, makes it ideal for reverse genetic studies. For forward genetic studies, experimental crosses and genetic analysis of progeny are essential. • Since P. patens is monoicous, producing both male and female gametes on the same gametophore, and undergoing self-fertilization at a high frequency, the identification of crossed sporophytes is difficult. Usually spores from many sporophytes from a mixed culture must be tested for the production of recombinant progeny. • Here, we describe the use of transgenic lines that express a fluorescent transgene constitutively, to provide a direct visual screen for hybrid sporophytes. • We show that segregations in crosses obtained with this technique are as expected, and demonstrate its utility for the study of the rate of outcrossing between three isolates of P. patens.},

abstract = {One contribution of 17 to a theme issue 'Evo-devo in the genomics era, and the origins of morphological diversity'. The colonization of land by plants shaped the terrestrial biosphere, the geo-sphere and global climates. The nature of morphological and molecular innovation driving land plant evolution has been an enigma for over 200 years. Recent phylogenetic and palaeobotanical advances jointly demon-strate that land plants evolved from freshwater algae and pinpoint key morphological innovations in plant evolution. In the haploid gametophyte phase of the plant life cycle, these include the innovation of mulitcellular forms with apical growth and multiple growth axes. In the diploid phase of the life cycle, multicellular axial sporophytes were an early innovation priming subsequent diversification of indeterminate branched forms with leaves and roots. Reverse and forward genetic approaches in newly emerging model sys-tems are starting to identify the genetic basis of such innovations. The data place plant evo-devo research at the cusp of discovering the developmental and genetic changes driving the radiation of land plant body plans. This article is part of the themed issue 'Evo-devo in the genomics era, and the origins of morphological diversity'.},

abstract = {When different tissues successively emerge during development, they need to be morphologically segregated from each other. Morphological segregation of tissues is often accompanied by robust changes in cell shape, and these two events are precisely coordinated. We overview recent progress in understanding how such coordination is regulated at the cellular and molecular levels using vertebrate somitogenesis as a unique model. In the formation of the somitic gap and its concomitant cell epithelialization, Ephrin-Eph intercellular signals play a central role, with Ephrin transducing intracellular signals via suppression of Cdc42. These signals lead to the activation of integrin where the segment border of somites forms, which in turn induces the assembly of fibronectin, the final player for the coordination. Intimate coupling of tissue-shape and cell-shape changes is also relevant to tumor suppression. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (F-actin) function cooperatively to regulate plant cell morphogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems, particularly in cell shape control, remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that introduction of the MyTH4-FERM tandem into KCBP (kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein) during evolution conferred novel functions. The MyTH4 domain and the FERM domain in the N-terminal tail of KCBP physically bind to MTs and F-actin, respectively. During trichome morphogenesis, KCBP distributes in a specific cortical gradient and concentrates at the branching sites and the apexes of elongating branches, which lack MTs but have cortical F-actin. Further, live-cell imaging and genetic analyses revealed that KCBP acts as a hub integrating MTs and actin filaments to assemble the required cytoskeletal configuration for the unique, polarized diffuse growth pattern during trichome cell morphogenesis. Our findings provide significant insights into the mechanisms underlying cytoskeletal regulation of cell shape determination.},

abstract = {Plant growth and architecture is regulated by the polar distribution of the hormone auxin. Polarity and flexibility of this process is provided by constant cycling of auxin transporter vesicles along actin filaments, coordinated by a positive auxin-actin feedback loop. Both polar auxin transport and vesicle cycling are inhibited by synthetic auxin transport inhibitors, such as 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), counteracting the effect of auxin; however, underlying targets and mechanisms are unclear. Using NMR, we map the NPA binding surface on the Arabidopsis thaliana ABCB chaperone TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1). We identify ACTIN7 as a relevant, although likely indirect, TWD1 interactor, and show TWD1-dependent regulation of actin filament organization and dynamics and that TWD1 is required for NPA-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling. The TWD1-ACTIN7 axis controls plasma membrane presence of efflux transporters, and as a consequence act7 and twd1 share developmental and physiological phenotypes indicative of defects in auxin transport. These can be phenocopied by NPA treatment or by chemical actin (de)stabilization. We provide evidence that TWD1 determines downstream locations of auxin efflux transporters by adjusting actin filament debundling and dynamizing processes and mediating NPA action on the latter. This function appears to be evolutionary conserved since TWD1 expression in budding yeast alters actin polarization and cell polarity and provides NPA sensitivity.},

abstract = {In plants and fungi, energetics at the plasma membrane is provided by a large protonmotive force (PMF) generated by the family of P-type ATPases specialized for proton transport (commonly called PM H+-ATPases or, in Arabidopsis, AHAs for Arabidopsis H+-ATPases). Studies have demonstrated that this 100-kDa protein is essential for plant growth and development. Posttranslational modifications of the H+-ATPase play crucial roles in its regulation. Phosphorylation of several Thr and Ser residues within the carboxy terminal regulatory domain composed of {\~{}}100 amino acids change in response to environmental stimuli, endogenous hormones, and nutrient conditions. Recently developed mass spectrometric technologies provide a means to carefully quantify these changes in H+-ATPase phosphorylation at the different sites. These chemical modifications can then be genetically tested in planta by complementing the loss-of-function aha mutants with phosphomimetic mutations. Interestingly, recent data suggest that phosphatase-mediated changes in PM H+-ATPase phosphorylation are important in mediating auxin-regulated growth. Thus, as with another hormone (abscisic acid), dephosphorylation by phosphatases, rather than kinase mediated phosphorylation, may be an important focal point for regulation during plant signal transduction. Although interactions with other proteins have also been implicated in ATPase regulation, the very hydrophobic nature and high concentration of this polytopic protein presents special challenges in evaluating the biological significance of these interactions. Only by combining biochemical and genetic experiments can we attempt to meet these challenges to understand the essential molecular details by which this protein functions in planta.},

abstract = {Background: Land plants evolved from aquatic algae more than 450 million years ago. Algal sisters of land plants grow through the activity of apical initial cells that cleave either in one plane to generate filaments or in two planes to generate mats. Acquisition of the capacity for cell cleavage in three planes facilitated the formation of upright bushy body plans and enabled the invasion of land. Evolutionary transitions between filamentous, planar, and bushy growth are mimicked within moss life cycles. Results: We have developed lineage analysis techniques to assess how transitions between growth forms occur in the moss Physcomitrella patens. We show that initial cells giving rise either to new filaments or bushy shoots are frequently juxtaposed on a single parent filament, suggesting a role for short-range cues in specifying differences in cell fate. Shoot initials cleave four times to establish a tetrahedral shape and subsequently cleave in three planes, generating bushy growth. Asymmetric and self-replacing divisions from the tetrahedral initial generate leaf initials that divide asymmetrically to self-replace and to produce daughter cells with restricted fate. The cessation of division in the leaf is distributed unevenly and contributes to final leaf shape. Conclusions: In contrast to flowering plants, changes in body plan in P. patens are regulated by cues acting at the level of single cells and are mediated through asymmetric divisions. Genetic mechanisms regulating shoot and leaf development in P. patens are therefore likely to differ substantially from mechanisms operating in plants with more recent evolutionary origins. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Cell expansion requires ordered arrangement of the cytoskeleton but molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation by signalling molecules including auxin are unknown. Here we show in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that in elongating cells exogenous application of auxin or redistribution of endogenous auxin induces very rapid microtubule re-orientation from transverse to longitudinal, coherent with the inhibition of cell expansion. This fast auxin effect requires auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1) and involves a contribution of downstream signalling components such as ROP6 GTPase, ROP-interactive protein RIC1 and the microtubule-severing protein katanin. These components are required for rapid auxin- and ABP1-mediated re-orientation of microtubules to regulate cell elongation in roots and dark-grown hypocotyls as well as asymmetric growth during gravitropic responses.},

abstract = {The architecture and adhesiveness of a cell microenvironment is a critical factor for the regulation of spindle orientation in vivo. Using a combination of theory and experiments, we have investigated spindle orientation in HeLa (human) cells. Here we show that spindle orientation can be understood as the result of the action of cortical force generators, which interact with spindle microtubules and are activated by cortical cues. We develop a simple physical description of this spindle mechanics, which allows us to calculate angular profiles of the torque acting on the spindle, as well as the angular distribution of spindle orientations. Our model accounts for the preferred spindle orientation and the shape of the full angular distribution of spindle orientations observed in a large variety of different cellular microenvironment geometries. It also correctly describes asymmetric spindle orientations, which are observed for certain distributions of cortical cues. We conclude that, on the basis of a few simple assumptions, we can provide a quantitative description of the spindle orientation of adherent cells. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Starch serves functions that range over a timescale of minutes to years, according to the cell type from which it is derived. In guard cells, starch is rapidly mobilized by the synergistic action of $\beta$-AMYLASE1 (BAM1) and $\alpha$-AMYLASE3 (AMY3) to promote stomatal opening. In the leaves, starch typically accumulates gradually during the day and is degraded at night by BAM3 to support heterotrophic metabolism. During osmotic stress, starch is degraded in the light by stress-activated BAM1 to release sugar and sugar-derived osmolytes. Here, we report that AMY3 is also involved in stress-induced starch degradation. Recently isolated Arabidopsis thaliana amy3 bam1 double mutants are hypersensitive to osmotic stress, showing impaired root growth. amy3 bam1 plants close their stomata under osmotic stress at similar rates as the wild type but fail to mobilize starch in the leaves. 14C labeling showed that amy3 bam1 plants have reduced carbon export to the root, affecting osmolyte accumulation and root growth during stress. Using genetic approaches, we further demonstrate that abscisic acid controls the activity of BAM1 and AMY3 in leaves under osmotic stress through the AREB/ABF-SnRK2 kinase-signaling pathway. We propose that differential regulation and isoform subfunctionalization define starch-adaptive plasticity, ensuring an optimal carbon supply for continued growth under an ever-changing environment.

By positioning wall-building enzymes, the cytoskeleton acts as an interior scaffold to direct construction of the cell's exterior. In plants, environmental and hormonal signals that modulate cell growth cause reorganization of cortical microtubule arrays. These arrays do not appear to be remodeled by moving individual microtubules, but rather by rules that govern how microtubules are assembled or disassembled. In this Research Article, we investigate the mechanism by which blue light, an important signal from the environment, causes a rapid 90° reorientation of cortical arrays in growing cells of the plant axis.},

abstract = {Little is known about the dynamics and molecular components of plant prevacuolar compartments (PVCs). We have demonstrated recently that vacuolar sorting receptor (VSR) proteins are concentrated on PVCs. In this study, we generated transgenic Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) BY-2 cell lines expressing two yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-fusion reporters that mark PVC and Golgi organelles. Both transgenic cell lines exhibited typical punctate YFP signals corresponding to distinct PVC and Golgi organelles because the PVC reporter colocalized with VSR proteins, whereas the Golgi marker colocalized with mannosidase I in confocal immunofluorescence. Brefeldin A induced the YFP-labeled Golgi stacks but not the YFP-marked PVCs to form typical enlarged structures. By contrast, wortmannin caused YFP-labeled PVCs but not YFP-labeled Golgi stacks to vacuolate. VSR antibodies labeled multivesicular bodies (MVBs) on thin sections prepared from high-pressure frozen/freeze substituted samples, and the enlarged PVCs also were indentified as MVBs. MVBs were further purified from BY-2 cells and found to contain VSR proteins via immunogold negative staining. Similar to YFP-labeled Golgi stacks, YFP-labeled PVCs are mobile organelles in BY-2 cells. Thus, we have unequivocally identified MVBs as PVCs in N. tabacum BY-2 cells. Uptake studies with the styryl dye FM4-64 strongly indicate that PVCs also lie on the endocytic pathway of BY-2 cells.},

abstract = {Polarized epithelia are fundamental to multicellular life. In animal epithelia, conserved junctional complexes establish membrane diffusion barriers, cellular adherence and sealing of the extracellular space. Plant cellular barriers are of independent evolutionary origin. The root endodermis strongly resembles a polarized epithelium and functions in nutrient uptake and stress resistance. Its defining features are the Casparian strips, belts of specialized cell wall material that generate an extracellular diffusion barrier. The mechanisms localizing Casparian strips are unknown. Here we identify and characterize a family of transmembrane proteins of previously unknown function. These 'CASPs' (Casparian strip membrane domain proteins) specifically mark a membrane domain that predicts the formation of Casparian strips. CASP1 displays numerous features required for a constituent of a plant junctional complex: it forms complexes with other CASPs; it becomes immobile upon localization; and it sediments like a large polymer. CASP double mutants display disorganized Casparian strips, demonstrating a role for CASPs in structuring and localizing this cell wall modification. To our knowledge, CASPs are the first molecular factors that are shown to establish a plasma membrane and extracellular diffusion barrier in plants, and represent a novel way of epithelial barrier formation in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Tissue mechanics have been shown to play a key role in the regulation of morphogenesis in animals [1-4] and may have an equally important role in plants [5-9]. The aerial organs of plants are formed at the shoot apical meristem following a specific phyllotactic pattern [10]. The initiation of an organ from the meristem requires a highly localized irreversible surface deformation, which depends on the demethylesterification of cell wall pectins [11]. Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate whether these chemical changes lead to changes in tissue mechanics. By mapping the viscoelasticity and elasticity in living meristems, we observed increases in tissue elasticity, correlated with pectin demethylesterification, in primordia and at the site of incipient organs. Measurements of tissue elasticity at various depths showed that, at the site of incipient primordia, the first increases occurred in subepidermal tissues. The results support the following causal sequence of events: (1) demethylesterification of pectin is triggered in subepidermal tissue layers, (2) this contributes to an increase in elasticity of these layers - the first observable mechanical event in organ initiation, and (3) the process propagates to the epidermis during the outgrowth of the organ. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the source(s) of the membrane needed for the rapid enlargement of PVCs/MVBs has been unclear. Using both confocal immunofluorescence and immunogold EM with high pressure freeze substitution of plant samples, it has been demonstrated here that wortmannin induces homotypic fusions of PVCs/MVBs thus providing an explanation for the demand for extra membrane. In addition, possible wortmannin-induced fusions between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and PVC, as well as between the small internal vesicles and PVC membrane, were also observed and they may also contribute to the membranes needed for PVC enlargement. In contrast to mammalian cells and yeast, wortmannin-induced fusion of PVCs appears to be unique to plants.},

Ectopic expression of CORD1 disturbed the parallel cortical microtubule array by promoting the detachment of microtubules from the plasma membrane. A reconstructive approach revealed that CORD1-induced disorganization of cortical microtubules impairs the boundaries of plasma membrane domains of active ROP11 GTPase, which govern pit formation. Our data suggest that CORD1 promotes cortical microtubule disorganization to regulate secondary cell wall pit formation. The Arabidopsis genome has six CORD1 paralogs that are expressed in various tissues during plant development, suggesting they are important for regulating cortical microtubules during plant development.},

abstract = {Summary The diverse forms of today's dominant vascular plant flora are generated by the sustained proliferative activity of sporophyte meristems at plants' shoot and root tips, a trait known as indeterminacy [1]. Bryophyte sister lineages to the vascular plants lack such indeterminate meristems and have an overall sporophyte form comprising a single small axis that ceases growth in the formation of a reproductive sporangium [1]. Genetic mechanisms regulating indeterminacy are well characterized in flowering plants, involving a feedback loop between class I KNOX genes and cytokinin [2, 3], and class I KNOX expression is a conserved feature of vascular plant meristems [4]. The transition from determinate growth to indeterminacy during evolution was a pre-requisite to vascular plant diversification, but mechanisms enabling the innovation of indeterminacy are unknown [5]. Here, we show that class I KNOX gene activity is necessary and sufficient for axis extension from an intercalary region of determinate moss shoots. As in Arabidopsis, class I KNOX activity can promote cytokinin biosynthesis by an ISOPENTENYL TRANSFERASE gene, PpIPT3. PpIPT3 promotes axis extension, and PpIPT3 and exogenously applied cytokinin can partially compensate for loss of class I KNOX function. By outgroup comparison, the results suggest that a pre-existing KNOX-cytokinin regulatory module was recruited into vascular plant shoot meristems during evolution to promote indeterminacy, thereby enabling the radiation of vascular plant shoot forms.},

abstract = {I. Abstract Recent research on the developmental anatomy and morphology of the fern sporophyte is reviewed. Detailed histological and experimental studies of the organization of the fern shoot apical meristem have reconfirmed the recently controversial role of the shoot apical cell as the single apical initial of the meristem. The shoot apical meristem is nevertheless an anatomically and functionally complex structure with a strongly zoned cytohistological organization. Fern shoot apex organization can be compared with that of seed plants. The control of leaf initiation and phyllotaxy remains poorly understood. Studies differ as to whether leaf initiation in ferns involves one leaf mother cell or a multicellular region of the shoot apex. The concept of non-appendicular fronds is refuted for living ferns. The later developmental changes in the determinate leaf apical and marginal meristems of the leaf primordium form an area that is still largely unexplored but could be investigated by methods similar to those used to study shoot and root apices.

abstract = {For almost a century the plant hormone auxin has been central to theories on apical dominance, whereby the growing shoot tip suppresses the growth of the axillary buds below. According to the classic model, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid is produced in the shoot tip and transported down the stem, where it inhibits bud growth. We report here that the initiation of bud growth after shoot tip loss cannot be dependent on apical auxin supply because we observe bud release up to 24 h before changes in auxin content in the adjacent stem. After the loss of the shoot tip, sugars are rapidly redistributed over large distances and accumulate in axillary buds within a timeframe that correlates with bud release. Moreover, artificially increasing sucrose levels in plants represses the expression of BRANCHED1 (BRC1), the key transcriptional regulator responsible for maintaining bud dormancy, and results in rapid bud release. An enhancement in sugar supply is both necessary and sufficient for suppressed buds to be released from apical dominance. Our data support a theory of apical dominance whereby the shoot tip's strong demand for sugars inhibits axillary bud outgrowth by limiting the amount of sugar translocated to those buds.},

abstract = {After fertilization, the zygote undergoes dynamic changes in chromosomal and cytoplasmic organization, and begins the cell cycles that eventually lead to formation of the multicellular embryo. Specific transcription factors that initiate this cascade of events in land plants have not been identified. We have identified two FLO/LFY genes, PpLFY1 and PpLFY2, that regulate the first cell division after formation of the zygote in the moss Physcomitrella patens. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two PpLFY genes are 94.8{\%} identical to each other and show similar expression patterns. While fertilization occurred in the PpLFY disruptants, the development of double disruptant zygotes was arrested at the single-cell stage. When the double disruptants, as the female parent, were crossed with the wild type, as the male parent, normal sporophytes were formed, supporting the notion that the PpLFY genes function after fertilization to regulate the first mitotic cell division in zygotes. The rare sporophytes that formed on the PpLFY double disruptants showed mostly normal organogenesis, but had abnormalities in the pattern of cell division, supporting a role of PpLFY genes in regulating cell division. The FLO/LFY genes in angiosperms are conserved master regulators of floral identity without any obvious effects on cell division. By contrast, our study suggests that FLO/LFY genes have functions throughout sporophyte development in the basal land plant lineages.},

Lignin is a major cell wall modification that often forms intricate subcellular patterns that are central to cellular function. Yet the mechanisms of lignin polymerization and the subcellular precision of its formation remain enigmatic. Here, we show that the Casparian strip, a lignin-based, paracellular diffusion barrier in plants, forms as a precise, median ring by the concerted action of a specific, localized NADPH oxidase, brought into proximity of localized peroxidases through the action of Casparian strip domain proteins (CASPs). Our findings in Arabidopsis provide a simple mechanistic model of how plant cells regulate lignin formation with subcellular precision. We speculate that scaffolding of NADPH oxidases to the downstream targets of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that they produce might be a widespread mechanism to ensure specificity and subcellular precision of ROS action within the extracellular matrix. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Selective uptake in multicellular organisms critically requires epithelia with extracellular diffusion barriers. In plants, such a barrier is provided by the endodermis and its Casparian strips - cell wall impregnations analogous to animal tight and adherens junctions. Interestingly, the endodermis undergoes secondary differentiation, becoming coated with hydrophobic suberin, presumably switching from an actively absorbing to a protective epithelium. Here, we show that suberization responds to a wide range of nutrient stresses, mediated by the stress hormones abscisic acid and ethylene. We reveal a striking ability of the root to not only regulate synthesis of suberin, but also selectively degrade it in response to ethylene. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in suberization constitute physiologically relevant, adaptive responses, pointing to a pivotal role of the endodermal membrane in nutrient homeostasis.},

The biological role of ATHB8 in vein formation and the molecular events that culminate in acquisition of the ATHB8 preprocambial cell state are unknown, but intertwined pathways of auxin transport and signal transduction have been implicated in defining paths of vascular strand differentiation. Here we show that ATHB8 is required to stabilize preprocambial cell specification against auxin transport perturbations, to restrict preprocambial cell state acquisition to narrow fields and to coordinate procambium formation within and between veins. We further show that ATHB8 expression at preprocambial stages is directly and positively controlled by the auxin-response transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) through an auxin-response element in the ATHB8 promoter. We finally show that the consequences of loss of ATHB8 function for vein formation are masked by MP activity.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Ding et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Our ability to identify genes that participate in cell growth and division is limited because their loss often leads to lethality. A solution to this is to isolate conditional mutants where the phenotype is visible under restrictive conditions. Here, we capitalize on the haploid growth-phase of the moss Physcomitrella patens to identify conditional loss-of-growth (CLoG) mutants with impaired growth at high temperature. We used whole-genome sequencing of pooled segregants to pinpoint the lesion of one of these mutants (clog1) and validated the identified mutation by rescuing the conditional phenotype by homologous recombination. We found that CLoG1 is a novel and ancient gene conserved in plants. At the restrictive temperature, clog1 plants have smaller cells but can complete cell division, indicating an important role of CLoG1 in cell growth, but not an essential role in cell division. Fluorescent protein fusions of CLoG1 indicate it is localized to microtubules with a bias towards depolymerizing microtubule ends. Silencing CLoG1 decreases microtubule dynamics, suggesting that CLoG1 plays a critical role in regulating microtubule dynamics. By discovering a novel gene critical for plant growth, our work demonstrates that P. patens is an excellent genetic system to study genes with a fundamental role in plant cell growth.},

Single mutations in the PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) and PINOID (PID) genes, which mediate auxin-dependent organ formation, moderately disrupt the symmetric patterning of cotyledons. We report that the pin1 pid double mutant displays a striking phenotype that completely lacks cotyledons and bilateral symmetry. In the double mutant embryo, the expression domains of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), CUC2 and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), the functions of which are normally required to repress growth at cotyledon boundaries, expand to the periphery and overlap with a cotyledon-specific marker, FILAMENTOUS FLOWER. Elimination of CUC1, CUC2 or STM activity leads to recovery of cotyledon growth in the double mutant, suggesting that the negative regulation of these boundary genes by PIN1 and PID is sufficient for primordium growth. We also show that PID mRNA is localized mainly to the boundaries of cotyledon primordia and early expression of PID mRNA is dependent on PIN1. Our results demonstrate the redundant roles of PIN1 and PID in the establishment of bilateral symmetry, as well as in the promotion of cotyledon outgrowth, the latter of which involves the negative regulation of CUC1, CUC2 and STM genes, which are boundary-specific downstream effectors.},

Microtubules depolymerize when encountering sharp cell edges head-on, whereas those oriented parallel to those sharp edges remain. Edge-induced microtubule depolymerization, however, is overcome by the microtubule-associated protein CLASP, which accumulates at specific cell edges, enables microtubule growth around sharp edges and promotes formation of microtubule bundles that span adjacent cell faces. By computationally modelling dynamic 'microtubules on a cube' with edges differentially permissive to microtubule passage, we show that the CLASP-edge complex is a 'tuneable' microtubule organizer, with the inherent flexibility to generate the numerous cortical array patterns observed in nature. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A nuclear auxin-signaling system controlling auxin-induced gene expression is well established, but cytoplasmic auxin signaling, as in its coordination of cell polarization, is unexplored. We found a cytoplasmic auxin-signaling mechanism that modulates the interdigitated growth of Arabidopsis leaf epidermal pavement cells (PCs), which develop interdigitated lobes and indentations to form a puzzle-piece shape in a two-dimensional plane. PC interdigitation is compromised in leaves deficient in either auxin biosynthesis or its export mediated by PINFORMED 1 localized at the lobe tip. Auxin coordinately activates two Rho GTPases, ROP2 and ROP6, which promote the formation of complementary lobes and indentations, respectively. Activation of these ROPs by auxin occurs within 30 s and depends on AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1.

abstract = {The forms resulting from growth processes are highly sensitive to the nature of the driving impetus, and to the local properties of the medium, in particular, its isotropy or anisotropy. In turn, these local properties can be organized by growth. Here, we consider a growing plant tissue, the shoot apical meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana. In plants, the resistance of the cell wall to the growing internal turgor pressure is the main factor shaping the cells and the tissues. It is well established that the physical properties of the walls depend on the oriented deposition of the cellulose microfibrils in the extracellular matrix or cell wall; this order is correlated to the highly oriented cortical array of microtubules attached to the inner side of the plasma membrane. We used oryzalin to depolymerize microtubules and analyzed its influence on the growing meristem. This had no short-term effect, but it had a profound impact on the cell anisotropy and the resulting tissue growth. The geometry of the cells became similar to that of bubbles in a soap froth. At a multicellular scale, this switch to a local isotropy induced growth into spherical structures. A theoretical model is presented in which a cellular structure grows through the plastic yielding of its walls under turgor pressure. The simulations reproduce the geometrical properties of a normal tissue if cell division is included. If not, a "cell froth" very similar to that observed experimentally is obtained. Our results suggest strong physical constraints on the mechanisms of growth regulation.},

These self-regulating auxin gradients are established by the action of PIN auxin transporters, whose activity is regulated by their constitutive cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes. Here, we show that auxin signaling by the auxin receptor AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) inhibits the clathrin-mediated internalization of PIN proteins. ABP1 acts as a positive factor in clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane, thereby promoting endocytosis. Auxin binding to ABP1 interferes with this action and leads to the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our study demonstrates that ABP1 mediates a nontranscriptional auxin signaling that regulates the evolutionarily conserved process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and suggests that this signaling may be essential for the developmentally important feedback of auxin on its own transport.},

abstract = {A fundamental and unresolved problem in animal development is the question of how a growing tissue knows when it has achieved its correct final size. A widely held view suggests that this process is controlled by morphogen gradients, which adapt to tissue size and become flatter as tissue grows, leading eventually to growth arrest. Here, we present evidence that the decapentaplegic (Dpp) morphogen distribution in the developing Drosophila wing imaginal disk does not adapt to disk size. We measure the distribution of a functional Dpp-GFP transgene and the Dpp signal transduced by phospho-Mad and show that the characteristic length scale of the Dpp profile remains approximately constant during growth. This finding suggests an alternative scenario of size determination, where disk size is determined relative to the fixed morphogen distribution by a certain threshold level of morphogen required for growth. We propose that when disk boundary reaches the threshold the arrest of cell proliferation throughout the disk is induced by mechanical stress in the tissue. Mechanical stress is expected to arise from the nonuniformity of morphogen distribution that drives growth. This stress, through a negative feedback on growth, can compensate for the nonuniformity of morphogen, achieving uniform growth with the rate that vanishes when disk boundary reaches the threshold. The mechanism is demonstrated through computer simulations of a tissue growth model that identifies the key assumptions and testable predictions. This analysis provides an alternative hypothesis for the size determination process. Novel experimental approaches will be needed to test this model. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Microtubules confined to the two-dimensional cortex of elongating plant cells must form a parallel yet dispersed array transverse to the elongation axis for proper cell wall expansion. Some of these microtubules exhibit free minus-ends, leading to migration at the cortex by hybrid treadmilling. Collisions between microtubules can result in plus-end entrainment (“zippering”) or rapid depolymerization. Here, we present a computational model of cortical microtubule organization. We find that plus-end entrainment leads to self-organization of microtubules into parallel arrays, whereas catastrophe-inducing collisions do not. Catastrophe-inducing boundaries (e.g., upper and lower cross-walls) can tune the orientation of an ordered array to a direction transverse to elongation. We also find that changes in dynamic instability parameters, such as in mor1-1 mutants, can impede self-organization, in agreement with experimental data. Increased entrainment, as seen in clasp-1 mutants, conserves self-organization, but delays its onset and fails to demonstrate increased ordering. We find that branched nucleation at acute angles off existing microtubules results in distinctive sparse arrays and infer either that microtubule-independent or coparallel nucleation must dominate. Our simulations lead to several testable predictions, including the effects of reduced microtubule severing in katanin mutants.},

abstract = {Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibres consist of single cells that grow in a highly polarized manner, assumed to be controlled by the cytoskeleton 1-3. However, how the cytoskeletal organization and dynamics underpin fibre development remains unexplored. Moreover, it is unclear whether cotton fibres expand via tip growth or diffuse growth 2-4. We generated stable transgenic cotton plants expressing fluorescent markers of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Live-cell imaging revealed that elongating cotton fibres assemble a cortical filamentous actin network that extends along the cell axis to finally form actin strands with closed loops in the tapered fibre tip. Analyses of F-actin network properties indicate that cotton fibres have a unique actin organization that blends features of both diffuse and tip growth modes. Interestingly, typical actin organization and endosomal vesicle aggregation found in tip-growing cell apices were not observed in fibre tips. Instead, endomembrane compartments were evenly distributed along the elongating fibre cells and moved bi-directionally along the fibre shank to the fibre tip. Moreover, plus-end tracked microtubules transversely encircled elongating fibre shanks, reminiscent of diffusely growing cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that cotton fibres elongate via a unique tip-biased diffuse growth mode. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibres are highly specialized, uni-cellular seed trichomes that develop through four distinct stages: fibre initiation, fibre elongation, secondary cell wall synthesis and maturation 5,6. The fibre cells undergo highly polarized growth, with the length-to-diameter ratio reaching 1,000 to 3,000 5. During growth, the cotton fibres produce an astounding amount of cellulose that accounts for more than 95{\%} of the dry weight of mature fibres 5. Therefore, in addition to their importance for the textile industry 7 , cotton fibres provide an excellent model to investigate polar cell elon-gation and cellulose biosynthesis 5,6. Reverse genetic studies revealed that many genes encoding proteins associated with the cytoskeleton are essential for fibre elongation and cell wall synthesis 1,8-12. In addition , comparative transcriptomic and genomic analyses, as well as genetic studies of natural fibre mutants, have demonstrated that the cytoskeleton has greatly contributed to domestication and cotton fibre traits across locations in Asia, Africa and the Americas 13-15. Consequently, many cytoskeleton-related genes were positively selected during cotton domestication; for example, several pro-filin-encoding genes, the FORMIN HOMOLOGY INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (FIP1) gene and the gene encoding a type XI-K myo-sin (GhXIK; Gh{\_}A13G1707) were selected for cotton fibre elonga-tion 16-18. It is therefore of great importance to study and understand how the cytoskeleton functions in cotton fibre development. Difficulties in generating stable transformants, and subsequent live-cell imaging, of cotton fibres have impaired visualization and analyses of the cytoskeleton. Although immunolabelling of fixed, cultured cotton fibres has been used to study cytoskeletal features during fibre development 1 , it is difficult to discern how the fixa-tion protocols affect the organization of the cytoskeleton, and the spatio-temporal behaviour of the cytoskeleton during cotton fibre growth remains unexplored. Most plant cells expand via diffuse growth, in which cell expansion and cell wall synthesis take place relatively evenly across the entire cell surface. By contrast, some specialized cell types, such as pollen tubes and root hairs, exhibit tip growth, in which cell expansion and wall deposition occur at the cell apex 19,20. Due to their highly elongated morphology, cotton fibre cells have often been regarded as tip-growing cells 2,3. However, a diffuse growth mode has been proposed due to the presence of transversely arranged microtubules perpendicular to the growth axis of elongating cotton fibres and flax phloem fibres 4,9,21-24. This discrepancy prompted scientists to propose a linear cell growth hypothesis for fibre elongation, in which the fibre shank expands via diffuse growth and the fibre apex via tip growth 2. The dispute, however, remains unresolved, and it is therefore not clear whether cotton fibre cells elongate via diffuse growth, tip growth or linear growth. To investigate the spatial organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in fibre cells, we introduced the actin filament (F-actin) reporter ABD2-GFP into cotton via stable transformation. Homozygous transgenic T3 progeny lines, which were indistinguishable from wild-type plants and expressed detectable levels of the F-actin reporter ABD2-GFP, were selected for subsequent live-cell imaging (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). We observed intact and dynamic F-actin networks in various cell types of the transgenic lines (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Together, these results indicate that ABD2-GFP can be produced in stable transgenic cotton lines and that the ABD2-GFP labelling did not disturb the growth and development of the cotton plants. To explore the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during cotton fibre development, we acquired z-stack images of living fibre cells at various developmental stages. Notably, the actin cytoskel-eton forms a continuous cortical network in growing cotton fibres},

The molecular features of the CDS have remained elusive for decades.

abstract = {The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.},

abstract = {The plant hormone auxin has crucial roles in almost all aspects of plant growth and development. Concentrations of auxin vary across different tissues, mediating distinct developmental outcomes and contributing to the functional diversity of auxin. However, the mechanisms that underlie these activities are poorly understood. Here we identify an auxin signalling mechanism, which acts in parallel to the canonical auxin pathway based on the transport inhibitor response1 (TIR1) and other auxin receptor F-box (AFB) family proteins (TIR1/AFB receptors)1,2, that translates levels of cellular auxin to mediate differential growth during apical-hook development. This signalling mechanism operates at the concave side of the apical hook, and involves auxin-mediated C-terminal cleavage of transmembrane kinase 1 (TMK1). The cytosolic and nucleus-translocated C terminus of TMK1 specifically interacts with and phosphorylates two non-canonical transcriptional repressors of the auxin or indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) family (IAA32 and IAA34), thereby regulating ARF transcription factors. In contrast to the degradation of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors in the canonical pathway, the newly identified mechanism stabilizes the non-canonical IAA32 and IAA34 transcriptional repressors to regulate gene expression and ultimately inhibit growth. The auxin–TMK1 signalling pathway originates at the cell surface, is triggered by high levels of auxin and shares a partially overlapping set of transcription factors with the TIR1/AFB signalling pathway. This allows distinct interpretations of different concentrations of cellular auxin, and thus enables this versatile signalling molecule to mediate complex developmental outcomes.},

The angiosperm female gametophyte is critical to the reproductive process. It is the structure within which egg cell production and fertilization take place. In addition, the female gametophyte plays a role in pollen tube guidance, the induction of seed development, and the maternal control of seed development. Genetic analysis in Arabidopsis has uncovered mutations that affect female gametophyte development and function. Mutants defective in almost all stages of development have been identified, and analysis of these mutants is beginning to reveal features of the female gametophyte developmental program. Other mutations that affect female gametophyte function have uncovered regulatory genes required for the induction of endosperm development. From these studies, we are beginning to understand the regulatory networks involved in female gametophyte development and function. Further investigation of the female gametophyte will require complementary approaches including expression-based approaches to obtain a complete profile of the genes functioning within this critical structure.},

abstract = {Auxin plays a key role in embryogenesis and seedling development, but the auxin sources for the two processes are not defined. Here, we demonstrate that auxin synthesized by the YUCCA (YUC) flavin monooxygenases is essential for the establishment of the basal body region during embryogenesis and the formation of embryonic and postembryonic organs. Both YUC1 and YUC4 are expressed in discrete groups of cells throughout embryogenesis, and their expression patterns overlap with those of YUC10 and YUC11 during embryogenesis. The quadruple mutants of yuc1 yuc4 yuc10 yuc11 fail to develop a hypocotyl and a root meristem, a phenotype similar to those of mp and tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 auxin signaling mutants. We further show that YUC genes play an essential role in the formation of rosette leaves by analyzing combinations of yuc mutants and the polar auxin transport mutants pin1 and aux1. Disruption of YUC1, YUC4, or PIN1 alone does not abolish leaf formation, but the triple mutant yuc1 yuc4 pin1 fails to form leaves and flowers. Furthermore, disruption of auxin influx carrier AUX1 in the quadruple mutant yuc1 yuc2 yuc4 yuc6, but not in wild-type background, phenocopies yuc1 yuc4 pin1, demonstrating that auxin influx is required for plant leaf and flower development. Our data demonstrate that auxin synthesized by the YUC flavin monooxygenases is an essential auxin source for Arabidopsis thaliana embryogenesis and postembryonic organ formation.},

abstract = {The division of eukaryotic cells involves the assembly of complex cytoskeletal structures to exert the forces required for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. In plants, empirical evidence suggests that tensional forces within the cytoskeleton cause cells to divide along the plane that minimizes the surface area of the cell plate (Errera's rule) while creating daughter cells of equal size. However, exceptions to Errera's rule cast doubt on whether a broadly applicable rule can be formulated for plant cell division. Here, we show that the selection of the plane of division involves a competition between alternative configurations whose geometries represent local area minima. We find that the probability of observing a particular division configuration increases inversely with its relative area according to an exponential probability distribution known as the Gibbs measure. Moreover, a comparison across land plants and their most recent algal ancestors confirms that the probability distribution is widely conserved and independent of cell shape and size. Using a maximum entropy formulation, we show that this empirical division rule is predicted by the dynamics of the tense cytoskeletal elements that lead to the positioning of the preprophase band. Based on the fact that the division plane is selected from the sole interaction of the cytoskeleton with cell shape, we posit that the new rule represents the default mechanism for plant cell division when internal or external cues are absent.},

abstract = {How genes shape diverse plant and animal body forms is a key question in biology. Unlike animal cells, plant cells are confined by rigid cell walls, and cell division plane orientation and growth rather than cell movement determine overall body form. The emergence of plants on land coincided with a new capacity to rotate stem cell divisions through multiple planes, and this enabled three-dimensional (3D) forms to arise from ancestral forms constrained to 2D growth. The genes involved in this evolutionary innovation are largely unknown. The evolution of 3D growth is recapitulated during the development of modern mosses when leafy shoots arise from a filamentous (2D) precursor tissue. Here, we show that a conserved, CLAVATA peptide and receptor-like kinase pathway originated with land plants and orients stem cell division planes during the transition from 2D to 3D growth in a moss, Physcomitrella. We find that this newly identified role for CLAVATA in regulating cell division plane orientation is shared between Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis. We report that roles for CLAVATA in regulating cell proliferation and cell fate are also shared and that CLAVATA-like peptides act via conserved receptor components in Physcomitrella. Our results suggest that CLAVATA was a genetic novelty enabling the morphological innovation of 3D growth in land plants. Whitewoods, Cammarata, et al. show that a conserved CLAVATA (CLV) pathway arose in the last common ancestor of land plants. CLV regulates cell division plane orientation during the 2D to 3D growth transition in a moss, and roles for CLV are shared between mosses and flowering plants, suggesting that CLV enabled 3D growth to arise in land plants.},

Similar proteins, AtRHD6 and AtRSL1, control the development of root hairs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Auxin positively regulates root hair development independently of AtRHD6 and AtRSL1 in A. thaliana but the regulatory interactions between auxin and PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 are unknown. We show here that co-expression of PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 is sufficient for the development of the rhizoid system in the moss P. patens; constitutive expression of PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 converts developing leafy shoot axes (gametophores) into rhizoids. During wild-type development, PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 are expressed in the specialized cells that develop rhizoids, indicating that cell-specific expression of PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 is sufficient to promote rhizoid differentiation during wild-type P. patens development. In contrast to A. thaliana, auxin promotes rhizoid development by positively regulating PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 activity in P. patens. This indicates that even though the same genes control the development of root hairs and rhizoids, the regulation of this transcriptional network by auxin is different in these two species. This suggests that auxin might have controlled the development of the first land plant soil anchoring systems that evolved 465 million years ago by regulating the expression of RSL genes and that this regulatory network has changed since mosses and angiosperms last shared a common ancestor.},

Cortical microtubules are thought to orient the direction of cell expansion primarily via their influence on the de-position of cellulose into the wall, although the precise nature of the microtubule-cellulose relationship remains unclear. In both tip-growing and diffusely growing cell types, F-actin promotes growth and also contributes to the spatial regulation of growth. F-actin has been proposed to play a variety of roles in the regulation of secretion in expanding cells, but its functions in cell growth control are not well understood. Recent work highlighted in this review on the morphogenesis of selected cell types has yielded substantial new insights into mechanisms governing the dynamics and organization of cytoskeletal filaments in expanding plant cells and how microtubules and F-actin interact to direct patterns of cell growth. Nevertheless, many important questions remain to be answered.},

abstract = {Most land plants have shoots that form branches and plants can regulate when and where they grow these branches to best exploit their environment. Plants with flowers and the more ancient mosses both have branching shoots, but these two groups of plants evolved to grow in this way independently of each other. Most studies on shoot branching have focused on flowering plants and so it is less clear how branching works in mosses. Three plant hormones—called auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone—control shoot branching in flowering plants. Auxin moves down the main shoot of the plant to prevent new branches from forming. This movement is controlled by the PIN proteins and several other families of proteins. On the other hand, cytokinin promotes the growth of new branches; and strigolactone can either promote or inhibit shoot branching depending on how the auxin is travelling around the plant. Coudert, Palubicki et al. studied shoot branching in a species of moss called Physcomitrella patens. The experiments show that cells on the outer surface of the main shoot are essentially reprogrammed to become so-called ‘branch initials', which will then develop into new branches. Next, Coudert, Palubicki et al. made a computational model that was able to simulate the pattern of shoot branching in the moss. Further experiments supported the predictions made by the model. Coudert, Palubicki et al. found that, as in flowering plants, auxin from the tip of the main shoot suppresses branching in the moss, and cytokinin promotes branching. The experiments also showed that strigolactone inhibits shoot branching, but its role is restricted to the base of the shoots. The model predicts that, unlike in flowering plants, auxin must flow in both directions in moss shoots to produce the observed patterns of shoot branching. Also, the experiments suggest that the PIN proteins and another group of proteins that control the movement of auxin do not regulate shoot branching in moss. Instead, it appears that auxin may move through microscopic channels that link one moss cell to the next. Coudert, Palubicki et al.'s findings suggest that both flowering plants and mosses have evolved to use the same three hormones to control shoot branching, but that these hormones interact in different ways. One key next step will be to find out how auxin is transported during shoot branching in moss by manipulating the opening of the channels between the cells. A further challenge will be to find out the precise details of how the hormones control the activity of the branch initial cells.},

Patterns can be observed on every level from subcellular to organismal and may emerge from local rules that correspond to the interactions between molecules, cells, or tissues. The emergence of robust patterns may seem in contradiction with the prominent heterogeneity at subcellular and cellular scales, however it has become increasingly clear that heterogeneity can be instrumental for pattern formation. Here we review recent examples in plant development, involving genetic regulation, cell arrangement, growth and signal gradient. We discuss how patterns emerge from local rules, whether heterogeneity is stochastic or can be patterned, and whether stochastic noise is amplified or requires filtering for robust patterns to be achieved. We also stress the importance of modelling in investigating such questions.},

Polyhedral plant cells can display complex patterning in which individual faces are established as biochemically distinct domains by endomembrane trafficking. We now show that, during organogenesis, the Arabidopsis endomembrane system specifies an important additional cellular spatial domain: the geometric edges. Previously unidentified membrane vesicles lying immediately beneath the plasma membrane at cell edges were revealed through localization of RAB-A5c, a plant GTPase of the Rab family of membrane-trafficking regulators. Specific inhibition of RAB-A5c activity grossly perturbed cell geometry in developing lateral organs by interfering independently with growth anisotropy and cytokinesis without disrupting default membrane trafficking. The initial loss of normal cell geometry can be explained by a failure to maintain wall stiffness specifically at geometric edges. RAB-A5c thus meets a requirement to specify this cellular spatial domain during organogenesis.},

abstract = {The formation of the leaf vascular pattern has fascinated biologists for centuries. In the early leaf primordium, complex networks of procambial cells emerge from homogeneous subepidermal tissue. The molecular nature of the underlying positional information is unknown, but various lines of evidence implicate gradually restricted transport routes of the plant hormone auxin in defining sites of procambium formation. Here we show that a crucial member of the AtPIN family of auxin-efflux-associated proteins, AtPIN1, is expressed prior to pre-procambial and procambial cell fate markers in domains that become restricted toward sites of procambium formation. Subcellular AtPIN1 polarity indicates that auxin is directed to distinct "convergence points" in the epidermis, from where it defines the positions of major veins. Integrated polarities in all emerging veins indicate auxin drainage toward pre-existing veins, but veins display divergent polarities as they become connected at both ends. Auxin application and transport inhibition reveal that convergence point positioning and AtPIN1 expression domain dynamics are self-organizing, auxin-transport-dependent processes. We derive a model for self-regulated, reiterative patterning of all vein orders and postulate at its onset a common epidermal auxin-focusing mechanism for major-vein positioning and phyllotactic patterning.},

To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using $\alpha$-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (auxinole), $\alpha$-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of ABP1, abp1-c1 and abp1-TD1, and the TILLING mutant abp1-5 We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like swelling response. In the ABP1-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.},

abstract = {Stem cells are formed at particular times and positions during the development of multicellular organisms. Whereas flowering plants form stem cells only in the sporophyte generation, non-seed plants form stem cells in both the sporophyte and gametophyte generations. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell formation in the sporophyte generation have been extensively studied, only a few transcription factors involved in the regulation of gametophyte stem cell formation have been reported. The moss Physcomitrella patens forms a hypha-like body (protonema) and a shoot-like body (gametophore) from a protonema apical cell and a gametophore apical cell, respectively. These apical cells have stem cell characteristics and are formed as side branches of differentiated protonema cells. Here, we show that four AP2-type transcription factors orthologous to Arabidopsis thaliana AINTEGUMENTA, PLETHORA and BABY BOOM (APB) are indispensable for the formation of gametophore apical cells from protonema cells. Quadruple disruption of all APB genes blocked gametophore formation, even in the presence of cytokinin, which enhances gametophore apical cell formation in the wild type. All APB genes were expressed in emerging gametophore apical cells, but not in protonema apical cells. Heat-shock induction of an APB4 transgene driven by a heat-shock promoter increased the number of gametophores. Expression of all APB genes was induced by auxin but not by cytokinin. Thus, the APB genes function synergistically with cytokinin signaling to determine the identity of the two types of stem cells.},

We show that leaf shape depends on the interplay of two growth modes: a conserved organ-wide growth mode that reflects differentiation; and a local, directional mode that involves the patterning of growth foci along the leaf edge. Shape diversity results from the distinct effects of two homeobox genes on these growth modes: SHOOTMERISTEMLESS broadens organ-wide growth relative to edge-patterning, enabling leaflet emergence, while REDUCED COMPLEXITY inhibits growth locally around emerging leaflets, accentuating shape differences created by patterning. We demonstrate the predictivity of our findings by reconstructing key features of C. hirsuta leaf morphology in A. thaliana. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

abstract = {The endodermis is a root cell layer common to higher plants and of fundamental importance for root function and nutrient uptake. The endodermis separates outer (peripheral) from inner (central) cell layers by virtue of its Casparian strips, precisely aligned bands of specialized wall material. Here we reveal that the membrane at the Casparian strip is a diffusional barrier between the central and peripheral regions of the plasma membrane and that it mediates attachment to the extracellular matrix. This membrane region thus functions like a tight junction in animal epithelia, although plants lack the molecular modules that establish tight junction in animals. We have also identified a pair of influx and efflux transporters that mark both central and peripheral domains of the plasma membrane. These transporters show opposite polar distributions already in meristems, but their localization becomes refined and restricted upon differentiation. This "central-peripheral" polarity coexists with the apical-basal polarity defined by PIN proteins within the same cells, but utilizes different polarity determinants. Central-peripheral polarity can be already observed in early embryogenesis, where it reveals a cellular polarity within the quiescent center precursor cell. A strict diffusion block between polar domains is common in animals, but had never been described in plants. Yet, its relevance to endodermal function is evident, as central and peripheral membranes of the endodermis face fundamentally different root compartments. Further analysis of endodermal transporter polarity and manipulation of its barrier function will greatly promote our understanding of plant nutrition and stress tolerance in roots.},

Land plants generate several types of stem cells that give rise to most organs of the plant body and whose characters determine the body organization.

Under gametangium-inducing conditions, multiple antheridium apical stem cells are formed at the tip of the gametophore and each antheridium apical stem cell divides to form an antheridium. We found that the gametophore apical stem cell, which typically forms leaf and stem tissues, changes to become a new type of stem cell, which we term the antheridium initial stem cell. This antheridium initial stem cell produces multiple antheridium apical stem cells, resulting in a cluster of antheridia at the tip of gametophore. This is the first report of a land plant stem cell directly producing another type of stem cell during normal development. Notably, the antheridium apical stem cells are distally produced from the antheridium initial stem cell, similar to the root cap stem cells of vascular plants, suggesting the use of similar molecular mechanisms and a possible evolutionary relationship.},

abstract = {Long-standing models propose that plant growth responses to light or gravity are mediated by asymmetric distribution of the phytohormone auxin. Physiological studies implicated a specific transport system that relocates auxin laterally, thereby effecting differential growth; however, neither the molecular components of this system nor the cellular mechanism of auxin redistribution on light or gravity perception have been identified. Here, we show that auxin accumulates asymmetrically during differential growth in an efflux-dependent manner. Mutations in the Arabidopsis gene PIN3, a regulator of auxin efflux, alter differential growth. PIN3 is expressed in gravity-sensing tissues, with PIN3 protein accumulating predominantly at the lateral cell surface. PIN3 localizes to the plasma membrane and to vesicles that cycle in an actin-dependent manner. In the root columella, PIN3 is positioned symmetrically at the plasma membrane but rapidly relocalizes laterally on gravity stimulation. Our data indicate that PIN3 is a component of the lateral auxin transport system regulating tropic growth. In addition, actin-dependent relocalization of PIN3 in response to gravity provides a mechanism for redirecting auxin flux to trigger asymmetric growth.},

Overexpression of APC blocks cell cycle progression. The APC-beta-catenin complex was shown to bind to DLG, the human homolog of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein. This interaction required the carboxyl-terminal region of APC and the DLG homology repeat region of DLG. APC colocalized with DLG at the lateral cytoplasm in rat colon epithelial cells and at the synapse in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that the APC-DLG complex may participate in regulation of both cell cycle progression and neuronal function.},

Recent work has demonstrated that the membrane alone, or through membrane-associated proteins, can effect dynamic changes to the cytoskeleton, thereby impacting cell physiology. Having identified mechanistic links between membranes and the actin, microtubule, and septin cytoskeletons, these studies highlight the membrane's central role in coordinating these cytoskeletal systems to carry out essential processes, such as endocytosis, spindle positioning, and cellular compartmentalization.},

Interphase transverse arrays of cortical microtubules self-organize through their dynamic instability and inter-microtubule interactions, and by branch-form microtubule nucleation and severing. Recent studies revealed that distinct spatial signals including ROP GTPase, cellular geometry, and mechanical stress regulate the behavior of cortical microtubules at the subcellular and supercellular levels, giving rise to dramatic rearrangements in the cortical microtubule array in response to internal and external cues. Increasing evidence indicates that negative regulators of microtubules also contribute to the rearrangement of the cortical microtubule array. In this review, I summarize recent insights into how the rearrangement of the cortical microtubule array leads to proper, flexible cell wall patterning.},

Here, we show that inducible nuclear localization of AN3 during initial leaf growth results in differential expression of important transcriptional regulators, including GROWTH REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs). Chromatin purification further revealed the presence of AN3 at the loci of GRF5, GRF6, CYTOKININ RESPONSE FACTOR2, CONSTANS-LIKE5 (COL5), HECATE1 (HEC1), and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR4 (ARR4). Tandem affinity purification of protein complexes using AN3 as bait identified plant SWITCH/SUCROSE NONFERMENTING (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes formed around the ATPases BRAHMA (BRM) or SPLAYED. Moreover, SWI/SNF ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 73B (SWP73B) is recruited by AN3 to the promoters of GRF5, GRF3, COL5, and ARR4, and both SWP73B and BRM occupy the HEC1 promoter. Furthermore, we show that AN3 and BRM genetically interact. The data indicate that AN3 associates with chromatin remodelers to regulate transcription. In addition, modification of SWI3C expression levels increases leaf size, underlining the importance of chromatin dynamics for growth regulation. Our results place the SWI/SNF-AN3 module as a major player at the transition from cell proliferation to cell differentiation in a developing leaf.},

abstract = {Auxin regulates most aspects of flowering-plant growth and development, including key developmental innovations that evolved within the vascular plant lineage after diverging from a bryophyte-like ancestor nearly 500 million years ago [1-3]. Recent studies in Arabidopsis indicate that auxin acts by directly binding the TIR1 subunit of the SCF TIR1 ubiq-uitin ligase; this binding results in degradation of the Aux/ IAA transcriptional repressors and de-repression of auxin-responsive genes [4-9]. Little is known, however, about the mechanism of auxin action in other plants. To characterize auxin signaling in a nonflowering plant, we utilized the genetically tractable moss Physcomitrella patens. We used a candidate-gene approach to show that previously identified auxin-resistant mutants of P. patens harbor mutations in Aux/IAA genes. Furthermore, we show that the moss Aux/IAA proteins interact with Arabidopsis TIR1 moss homologs called PpAFB and that a reduction in PpAFB levels results in a phenotype similar to that of the auxin-resistant mutants. Our results indicate that the molecular mechanism of auxin perception is conserved in land plants despite vast differences in the role auxin plays in different plant lineages.},

abstract = {Auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1) has been studied for decades. It has been suggested that ABP1 functions as an auxin receptor and has an essential role in many developmental processes. Here we present our unexpected findings that ABP1 is neither required for auxin signaling nor necessary for plant development under normal growth conditions. We used our ribozyme-based CRISPR technology to generate an Arabidopsis abp1 mutant that contains a 5-bp deletion in the first exon of ABP1, which resulted in a frameshift and introduction of early stop codons. We also identified a T-DNA insertion abp1 allele that harbors a T-DNA insertion located 27 bp downstream of the ATG start codon in the first exon. We show that the two new abp1 mutants are null alleles. Surprisingly, our new abp1 mutant plants do not display any obvious developmental defects. In fact, the mutant plants are indistinguishable from wild-type plants at every developmental stage analyzed. Furthermore, the abp1 plants are not resistant to exogenous auxin. At the molecular level, we find that the induction of known auxin-regulated genes is similar in both wild-type and abp1 plants in response to auxin treatments. We conclude that ABP1 is not a key component in auxin signaling or Arabidopsis development.},

abstract = {Precise knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of cell division, including number and orientation of divisions, and knowledge of cell expansion, is central to understanding morphogenesis. Our current knowledge of cell division patterns during plant and animal morphogenesis is largely deduced from analysis of clonal shapes and sizes. But such an analysis can reveal only the number, not the orientation or exact rate, of cell divisions. In this study, we have analyzed growth in real time by monitoring individual cell divisions in the shoot apical meristems (SAMs) of Arabidopsis thaliana. The live imaging technique has led to the development of a spatial and temporal map of cell division patterns. We have integrated cell behavior over time to visualize growth. Our analysis reveals temporal variation in mitotic activity and the cell division is coordinated across clonally distinct layers of cells. Temporal variation in mitotic activity is not correlated to the estimated plastochron length and diurnal rhythms. Cell division rates vary across the SAM surface. Cells in the peripheral zone (PZ) divide at a faster rate than in the central zone (CZ). Cell division rates in the CZ are relatively heterogeneous when compared with PZ cells. We have analyzed the cell behavior associated with flower primordium development starting from a stage at which the future flower comprises four cells in the L1 epidermal layer. Primordium development is a sequential process linked to distinct cellular behavior. Oriented cell divisions, in primordial progenitors and in cells located proximal to them, are associated with initial primordial outgrowth. The oriented cell divisions are followed by a rapid burst of cell expansion and cell division, which transforms a flower primordium into a three-dimensional flower bud. Distinct lack of cell expansion is seen in a narrow band of cells, which forms the boundary region between developing flower bud and the SAM. We discuss these results in the context of SAM morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the origin and evolution of land plants and their algal relatives is a fundamental problem in plant phylogenetics, and is essential for understanding how critical adaptations arose, including the embryo, vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. Despite advances in molecular systematics, some hypotheses of relationships remain weakly resolved. Inferring deep phylogenies with bouts of rapid diversification can be problematic; however, genome-scale data should significantly increase the number of informative characters for analyses. Recent phylogenomic reconstructions focused on the major divergences of plants have resulted in promising but inconsistent results. One limitation is sparse taxon sampling, likely resulting from the difficulty and cost of data generation. To address this limitation, transcriptome data for 92 streptophyte taxa were generated and analyzed along with 11 published plant genome sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted using up to 852 nuclear genes and 1,701,170 aligned sites. Sixty-nine analyses were performed to test the robustness of phylogenetic inferences to permutations of the data matrix or to phylogenetic method, including supermatrix, supertree, and coalescent-based approaches, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, partitioned and unpartitioned analyses, and amino acid versus DNA alignments. Among other results, we find robust support for a sister-group relationship between land plants and one group of streptophyte green algae, the Zygnematophyceae. Strong and robust support for a clade comprising liverworts and mosses is inconsistent with a widely accepted view of early land plant evolution, and suggests that phylogenetic hypotheses used to understand the evolution of fundamental plant traits should be reevaluated.},

abstract = {A peptide hormone, root meristem growth factor (RGF), regulates root meristem development through the PLETHORA (PLT) stem cell transcription factor pathway, but it remains to be uncovered how extracellular RGF signals are transduced to the nucleus. Here we identified, using a combination of a custom-made receptor kinase (RK) expression library and exhaustive photoaffinity labeling, three leucine-rich repeat RKs (LRR-RKs) that directly interact with RGF peptides in Arabidopsis. These three LRR-RKs, which we named RGFR1, RGFR2, and RGFR3, are expressed in root tissues including the proximal meristem, the elongation zone, and the differentiation zone. The triple rgfr mutant was insensitive to externally applied RGF peptide and displayed a short root phenotype accompanied by a considerable decrease in meristematic cell number. In addition, PLT1 and PLT2 protein gradients, observed as a gradual gradient decreasing toward the elongation zone from the stem cell area in wild type, steeply declined at the root tip in the triple mutant. Because RGF peptides have been shown to create a diffusion-based concentration gradient extending from the stem cell area, our results strongly suggest that RGFRs mediate the transformation of an RGF peptide gradient into a PLT protein gradient in the proximal meristem, thereby acting as key regulators of root meristem development.},

We show that Arabidopsis roots react to addition and removal of auxin by extremely rapid adaptation of growth rate. This process requires intracellular auxin perception but not transcriptional reprogramming. The formation of the canonical TIR1/AFB–Aux/IAA co-receptor complex is required for the growth regulation, hinting to a novel, non-transcriptional branch of this signalling pathway.

abstract = {Stem cells self-renew and produce cells that differentiate to become the source of the plant body. The moss Physcomitrella patens forms eight types of stem cells during its life cycle and serves as a useful model in which to explore the evolution of such cells. The common ancestor of land plants is inferred to have been haplontic and to have formed stem cells only in the gametophyte generation. A single stem cell would have been maintained in the ancestral gametophyte meristem, as occurs in extant basal land plants. During land plant evolution, stem cells diverged in the gametophyte generation to form different types of body parts, including the protonema and rhizoid filaments, leafy-shoot and thalloid gametophores, and gametangia formed in moss. A simplex meristem with a single stem cell was acquired in the sporophyte generation early in land plant evolution. Subsequently, sporophyte stem cells became multiple in the meristem and were elaborated further in seed plant lineages, although the evolutionary origin of niche cells, which maintain stem cells is unknown. Comparisons of gene regulatory networks are expected to give insights into the general mechanisms of stem cell formation and maintenance in land plants and provide information about their evolution. P. patens develops at least seven types of simplex meristem in the gametophyte and at least one type in the sporophyte generation and is a good material for regulatory network comparisons. In this review, we summarize recently revealed molecular mechanisms of stem cell initiation and maintenance in the moss. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we describe a new method, ergodic rate analysis (ERA), that uses single-cell measurements of fixed steady-state populations to accurately infer the rates of molecular events, including rates of cell growth. ERA exploits the fact that the number of cells in a particular state is related to the average transit time through that state. With this method, it is possible to calculate full time trajectories of any feature that can be labelled in fixed cells, for example levels of phosphoproteins or total cellular mass. Using ERA we find evidence for a size-discriminatory process at the G1/S transition that acts to decrease cell-to-cell size variation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Auxin-response factors (ARFs) bind with specificity to TGTCTC auxin-response elements (AuxREs), which are found in promoters of primary/early auxin-response genes. Nine different ARFs have been analyzed for their capacity to activate or repress transcription in transient expression assays employing auxin-responsive GUS reporter genes. One ARF appears to act as a repressor. Four ARFs function as activators and contain glutamine-rich activation domains. To achieve transcriptional activation on TGTCTC AuxREs in transient expression assays, ARFs require a conserved dimerization domain found in both ARF and Aux/IAA proteins, but they do not absolutely require their DNA-binding domains. Our results suggest that ARFs can activate or repress transcription by binding to AuxREs directly and that selected ARFs, when overexpressed, may potentiate activation further by associating with an endogenous transcription factor(s) (e.g., an ARF) that is bound to AuxREs. Transfection experiments suggest that TGTCTC AuxREs are occupied regardless of the auxin status in cells and that these occupied AuxREs are activated when exogenous auxin is applied to cells or when ARF activators are overexpressed. The results provide new insight into mechanisms involved with auxin regulation of primary/early-response genes.},

We found that morphogenesis at the Arabidopsis shoot apex depends on the microtubule cytoskeleton, which in turn is regulated by mechanical stress. A combination of experiments and modeling shows that a feedback loop encompassing tissue morphology, stress patterns, and microtubule-mediated cellular properties is sufficient to account for the coordinated patterns of microtubule arrays observed in epidermal cells, as well as for patterns of apical morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Key developmental processes that occur on the subcellular and cellular level or occur in occluded tissues are difficult to access, let alone image and analyze. Recently, culturing living samples within polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices has facilitated the study of hard-to-reach developmental events. Here, we show that an early diverging land plant, Physcomitrella patens, can be continuously cultured within PDMS microfluidic chambers. Because the PDMS chambers are bonded to a coverslip, it is possible to image P. patens development at high resolution over long time periods. Using PDMS chambers, we report that wild-type protonemal tissue grows at the same rate as previously reported for growth on solid medium. Using long-term imaging, we highlight key developmental events, demonstrate compatibility with high-resolution confocal microscopy, and obtain growth rates for a slow-growing mutant. By coupling the powerful genetic tools available to P. patens with long-term growth and imaging provided by PDMS microfluidic chambers, we demonstrate the capability to study cellular and subcellular developmental events in plants directly and in real time.},

abstract = {Land plant cells assemble microtubule arrays without a conspicuous microtubule organizing center like a centrosome. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the TONNEAU1 (TON1) proteins, which share similarity with FOP, a human centrosomal protein, are essential for microtubule organization at the cortex. We have identified a novel superfamily of 34 proteins conserved in land plants, the TON1 Recruiting Motif (TRM) proteins, which share six short conserved motifs, including a TON1-interacting motif present in all TRMs. An archetypal member of this family, TRM1, is a microtubule-associated protein that localizes to cortical microtubules and binds microtubules in vitro. Not all TRM proteins can bind microtubules, suggesting a diversity of functions for this family. In addition, we show that TRM1 interacts in vivo with TON1 and is able to target TON1 to cortical microtubules via its C-terminal TON1 interaction motif. Interestingly, three motifs of TRMs are found in CAP350, a human centrosomal protein interacting with FOP, and the C-terminal M2 motif of CAP350 is responsible for FOP recruitment at the centrosome. Moreover, we found that TON1 can interact with the human CAP350 M2 motif in yeast. Taken together, our results suggest conservation of eukaryotic centrosomal components in plant cells.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved. The outgrowth of axillary buds into branches is regulated systemically via plant hormones and the demand of growing shoot tips for sugars. The plant hormone auxin is thought to act via two mechanisms. One mechanism involves auxin regulation of systemic signals, cytokinins and strigolactones, which can move into axillary buds. The other involves suppression of auxin transport/canalization from axillary buds into the main stem and is enhanced by a low sink for auxin in the stem. In this theory, the relative ability of the buds and stem to transport auxin controls bud outgrowth. Here, we evaluate whether auxin transport is required or regulated during bud outgrowth in pea (Pisum sativum). The profound, systemic, and long-term effects of the auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid had very little inhibitory effect on bud outgrowth in strigolactone-deficient mutants. Strigolactones can also inhibit bud outgrowth in N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid-treated shoots that have greatly diminished auxin transport. Moreover, strigolactones can inhibit bud outgrowth despite a much diminished auxin supply in in vitro or decapitated plants. These findings demonstrate that auxin sink strength in the stem is not important for bud outgrowth in pea. Consistent with alternative mechanisms of auxin regulation of systemic signals, enhanced auxin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) can suppress branching in yucca1D plants compared with wild-type plants, but has no effect on bud outgrowth in a strigolactone-deficient mutant background.},

Lateral root primordia grow through overlying cell layers that must accommodate this incursion. Here, we analyze responses of the endodermis, the immediate neighbor to an initiating lateral root. Endodermal cells overlying lateral root primordia lose volume, change shape, and relinquish their tight junction-like diffusion barrier to make way for the emerging lateral root primordium. Endodermal feedback is absolutely required for initiation and growth of lateral roots, and we provide evidence that this is mediated by controlled volume loss in the endodermis. We propose that turgidity and rigid cell walls, typical of plants, impose constraints that are specifically modified for a given developmental process.},

abstract = {The phytohormone auxin is a major regulator of diverse aspects of plant growth and development. The ubiquitin-ligase complex SCFTIR1/AFB (for Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein), which includes the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB) auxin receptor family, has recently been demonstrated to be critical for auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation. Early-phase auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation, on the other hand, has long been explained by the acid-growth theory, for which proton extrusion by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase is a functional prerequisite. However, the mechanism by which auxin mediates H+-ATPase activation has yet to be elucidated. Here, we present direct evidence for H+- ATPase activation in etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by auxin through phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine during early-phase hypocotyl elongation. Application of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to endogenous auxin-depleted hypocotyl sections induced phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine of the H+-ATPase and increased H+-ATPase activity without altering the amount of the enzyme. Changes in both the phosphorylation level of H+- ATPase and IAA-induced elongation were similarly concentration dependent. Furthermore, IAA-induced H+-ATPase phosphorylation occurred in a tir1-1 afb2-3 double mutant, which is severely defective in auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation. In addition, $\alpha$-(phenylethyl-2-one)-IAA, the auxin antagonist specific for the nuclear auxin receptor TIR1/AFBs, had no effect on IAA-induced H+-ATPase phosphorylation. These results suggest that the TIR1/AFB auxin receptor family is not involved in auxin-induced H+-ATPase phosphorylation. Our results define the activation mechanism of H+-ATPase by auxin during early-phase hypocotyl elongation; this is the long-sought-after mechanism that is central to the acid-growth theory. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract = {A developing plant organ exhibits complex spatiotemporal patterns of growth, cell division, cell size, cell shape, and organ shape. Explaining these patterns presents a challenge because of their dynamics and cross-correlations, which can make it difficult to disentangle causes from effects. To address these problems, we used live imaging to determine the spatiotemporal patterns of leaf growth and division in different genetic and tissue contexts. In the simplifying background of the speechless (spch) mutant, which lacks stomatal lineages, the epidermal cell layer exhibits defined patterns of division, cell size, cell shape, and growth along the proximodistal and mediolateral axes. The patterns and correlations are distinctive from those observed in the connected subepidermal layer and also different from the epidermal layer of wild type. Through computational modelling we show that the results can be accounted for by a dual control model in which spatiotemporal control operates on both growth and cell division, with cross-connections between them. The interactions between resulting growth and division patterns lead to a dynamic distributions of cell sizes and shapes within a deforming leaf. By modulating parameters of the model, we illustrate how phenotypes with correlated changes in cell size, cell number, and organ size may be generated. The model thus provides an integrated view of growth and division that can act as a framework for further experimental study.},

abstract = {Cytokinesis in plants is achieved by the formation of the cell plate. A pathway that includes mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase and MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) plays a key role in the control of plant cytokinesis. We show here that a MAP kinase, MPK4, is required for the formation of the cell plate in Arabidopsis thaliana. Single mutations in MPK4 caused dwarfism and characteristic defects in cytokinesis, such as immature cell plates, which became much more prominent upon introduction of a mutation in MKK6/ANQ, the MAPKK for cytokinesis, into mpk4. MKK6/ANQ strongly activated MPK4 in protoplasts, and kinase activity of MPK4 was detected in wild-type tissues that contained dividing cells but not in mkk6/anq mutants. Fluorescent protein-fused MPK4 localized to the expanding cell plates in cells of root tips. Expansion of the cell plates in mpk4 root tips appeared to be retarded. The level of MPK11 transcripts was markedly elevated in mpk4 plants, and defects in the mpk4 mpk11 double mutant with respect to growth and cytokinesis were more severe than in the corresponding single mutants. These results indicate that MPK4 is the downstream target of MKK6/ANQ in the regulation of cytokinesis in Arabidopsis and that MPK11 is also involved in cytokinesis.},

abstract = {Auxin is a crucial growth regulator in plants. However, a comprehensive understanding of how auxin induces cell expansion is perplexing, because auxin acts in a concentration- and cell type-dependent manner. Consequently, it is desirable to focus on certain cell types to exemplify the underlying growth mechanisms. On the other hand, plant tissues display supracellular growth (beyond the level of single cells); hence, other cell types might compromise the growth of a certain tissue. Tip-growing cells do not display neighbor-induced growth constraints and, therefore, are a valuable source of information for growth-controlling mechanisms. Here, we focus on auxin-induced cellular elongation in root hairs, exposing a mechanistic view of plant growth regulation. We highlight a complex interplay between auxin metabolism and transport, steering root hair development in response to internal and external triggers. Auxin signaling modules and downstream cascades of transcription factors define a developmental program that appears rate limiting for cellular growth. With this knowledge in mind, the root hair cell is a very suitable model system in which to dissect cellular effectors required for cellular expansion.},

Here we use genetically-encoded pH and auxin signaling sensors, pharmacological and genetic manipulations available for Arabidopsis etiolated hypocotyls to clarify how auxin is perceived and the downstream growth executed. We show that auxin-induced acidification occurs by local activation of H +-ATPases, which in the context of gravity response is restricted to the lower organ side. This auxin-stimulated acidification and growth require TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA nuclear auxin perception. In addition, auxin-induced gene transcription and specifically SAUR proteins are crucial downstream mediators of this growth.

abstract = {Auxin is an essential regulator of plant organogenesis. Most key genes in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling belong to gene families, making it difficult to conduct genetic analysis of auxin action in plant development. Herein we report the functional analysis of several members of 2 gene families (NPY/ENP/MAB4 genes and AGC kinases) in auxin-mediated organogenesis and their relationships with the YUC family of flavin monooxygenases that are essential for auxin biosynthesis. We show that 5 NPY genes (NPY1 to NPY5) and 4 AGC kinases (PID, PID2, WAG1, and WAG2) have distinct, yet overlapping, expression patterns. Disruption of NPY1 does not cause obvious defects in organogenesis, but npy1 npy3 npy5 triple mutants failed to make flower primordia, a phenotype that is also observed when AGC kinase PID is compromised. Inactivation of YUC1 and YUC4 in npy1 background also phenocopies npy1 npy3 npy5 and pid. Simultaneous disruption of PID and its 3 closest homologs (PID2, WAG1, and WAG2) completely abolishes the formation of cotyledons, which phenocopies npy1 pid double mutants and yuc1 yuc4 pid triple mutants. Our results demonstrate that NPY genes and AGC kinases define 2 key steps in a pathway that controls YUC-mediated organogenesis in Arabidopsis.},

abstract = {Cytokinins are mobile multifunctional plant hormones with roles in development and stress resilience [1][1],[2][2]. Although cytokinin receptors are substantially localised to the endoplasmic reticulum [3][3]–[5][4], the cellular sites of cytokinin perception continue to be debated [1][1],[6][5],[7][6]. Several cytokinin types display bioactivity [8][7],[9][8] and recently a cell-specific cytokinin gradient was reported in roots [10][9]. Yet, the importance of spatially heterogeneous cytokinin distribution and the specific cytokinin(s) that account for the different responses remain unclear. Here we show that cytokinin perception by plasma membrane receptors is an effective path for cytokinin response in root cells. Readout from a Two Component Signalling cytokinin-specific reporter ( TCSn::GFP; [11][10]) is closely matched to intracellular cytokinin content, yet a proportion of bioactive cytokinins are detected in the extracellular fluid. Using cytokinins covalently linked to beads that could not pass the plasma membrane, we demonstrate that strong TCSn activation still occurs and that this response is greatly diminished in cytokinin receptor mutants. Although intracellular receptors play significant roles, we argue for a revision of concepts of cytokinin perception to include the spatial dimensions. In particular, selective ligand-receptor affinities, cellular localisation and tissue distribution of bioactive cytokinins, their receptors, transporters and inactivation enzymes appear all to be components of the signalling regulatory mechanisms.

abstract = {We present a classification of developmental mechanisms that have been shown experimentally to generate pattern and form in metazoan organisms. We propose that all such mechanisms can be organized into three basic categories and that two of these may act as composite mechanisms in two different ways. The simple categories are cell autonomous mechanisms in which cells enter into specific arrangements ('patterns') without interacting, inductive mechanisms in which cell communication leads to changes in pattern by reciprocal or hierarchical alteration of cell phenotypes ('states') and morphogenetic mechanisms in which pattern changes by means of cell interactions that do not change cell states. The latter two types of mechanism can be combined either morphostatically, in which case inductive mechanisms act first, followed by the morphogenetic mechanism, or morphodynamically, in which case both types of mechanisms interact continuously to modify each other's dynamics. We propose that this previously unexplored distinction in the operation of composite developmental mechanisms provides insight into the dynamics of many developmental processes. In particular, morphostatic and morphodynamic mechanisms respond to small changes in their genetic and microenvironmental components in dramatically different ways. We suggest that these differences in 'variational properties' lead to morphostatic and morphodynamic mechanisms being represented to different extents in early and late stages of development and to their contributing in distinct ways to morphological transitions in evolution.},

Concordantly, $\Delta$ppwox13l deletion mutants fail to upregulate genes encoding homologs of cell wall loosening factors during this process. During the moss life cycle, most of the $\Delta$ppwox13l mutant zygotes fail to expand and initiate an apical stem cell to form the embryo. Our data show that PpWOX13L genes are required for the initiation of cell growth specifically during stem cell formation, in analogy to WOX stem cell functions in seed plants, but using a different cellular mechanism.},

Higher plant cells do not possess such centrosome-like structures. Thus, the fundamental issues of where and how the intracellular plant MTs are nucleated remain highly debatable. A large body of evidence indicates that plant MTs emerge from the nuclear periphery. In this study, we developed an in vitro assay in which isolated maize nuclei nucleate MT assembly at a tubulin concentration (14 [mu]M of neurotubulin) that is not efficient for spontaneous MT assembly. No MT-stabilizing agents, such as taxol or dimethyl sulfoxide, were used. Our model provides evidence that the nuclear surface functions as a MT-nucleating site in higher plant cells. A monoclonal antibody raised against a pericentriolar antigen immunostained the surface of isolated nuclei, and a 100-kD polypeptide in 4 M urea-treated nuclear extracts was detected.},

Cardamine hirsuta, a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, uses an explosive mechanism to disperse its seeds. We show that this trait evolved through morphomechanical innovations at different spatial scales. At the organ scale, tension within the fruit wall generates the elastic energy required for explosion. This tension is produced by differential contraction of fruit wall tissues through an active mechanism involving turgor pressure, cell geometry, and wall properties of the epidermis. Explosive release of this tension is controlled at the cellular scale by asymmetric lignin deposition within endocarp b cells-a striking pattern that is strictly associated with explosive pod shatter across the Brassicaceae plant family. By bridging these different scales, we present an integrated mechanism for explosive seed dispersal that links evolutionary novelty with complex trait innovation. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

abstract = {A major transition in land plant evolution was from growth in water to growth on land. This transition necessitated major morphological innovations that were accompanied by the development of three-dimensional apical growth. In extant land plants, shoot growth occurs from groups of cells at the apex known as meristems. In different land plant lineages, meristems function in different ways to produce distinct plant morphologies, yet our understanding of the developmental basis of meristem function is limited to the most recently diverged angiosperms. To redress this balance, we have examined meristem function in the lycophyte Selaginella kraussiana. Using a clonal analysis, we show that S. kraussiana shoots are derived from the activity of two short-lived apical initials that facilitate the formation of four axes of symmetry in the shoot. Leaves are initiated from just two epidermal cells, and the mediolateral leaf axis is the first to be established. This pattern of development differs from that seen in flowering plants. These differences are discussed in the context of the development and evolution of diverse land plant forms.},

abstract = {The Polycomb group (PcG) complex is involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression profiles. In flowering plants, PcG proteins regulate vegetative and reproductive programs. Epigenetically inherited states established in the gametophyte generation are maintained after fertilization in the sporophyte generation, having a profound influence on seed development. The gametophyte size and phase dominance were dramatically reduced during angiosperm evolution, and have specialized in flowering plants to support the reproductive process. The moss Physcomitrella patens is an ideal organism in which to study epigenetic processes during the gametophyte stage, as it possesses a dominant photosynthetic gametophytic haploid phase and efficient homologous recombination, allowing targeted gene replacement. We show that P. patens PcG protein FIE (PpFIE) accumulates in haploid meristematic cells and in cells that undergo fate transition during dedifferentiation programs in the gametophyte. In the absence of PpFIE, meristems overproliferate and are unable to develop leafy gametophytes or reach the reproductive phase. This aberrant phenotype might result from failure of the PcG complex to repress proliferation and differentiation of three-faced apical stem cells, which are designated to become lateral shoots. The PpFIE phenotype can be partially rescued by FIE of Arabidopsis thaliana, a flowering plant that diverged {\textgreater}450 million years ago from bryophytes. PpFIE can partially complement the A. thaliana fie mutant, illustrating functional conservation of the protein during evolution in regulating the differentiation of meristematic cells in gametophyte development, both in bryophytes and angiosperms. This mechanism was harnessed at the onset of the evolution of alternating generations, facilitating the establishment of sporophytic developmental programs.},

Cell shape is the product of a cell's material and active properties balanced by external forces. Control of cell shape, therefore, relies on both tight regulation of intracellular mechanics and the cell's physical interaction with its environment. In this review, we first discuss the biological and physical mechanisms of cell shape control. We next examine a number of developmental processes in which cell shape change - either individually or in a coordinated manner - drives embryonic morphogenesis and discuss how cell shape is controlled in these processes. Finally, we emphasize that cell shape control during tissue morphogenesis can only be fully understood by using a combination of cellular, molecular, developmental and biophysical approaches. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we show that MIKCC-type MADS-box genes in the moss Physcomitrella patens function in two ways to enable fertilization. Analyses of protein localization, deletion mutants and overexpression lines of all six genes indicate that three MIKCC-type MADS-box genes redundantly regulate cell division and growth in the stems for appropriate external water conduction, as well as the formation of sperm with motile flagella.

abstract = {Pollen tube tip growth is a widely used model ideally suited to study cellular processes underlying polarized cell expansion. Local secretion supplying material for plasma membrane and cell wall extension is essential for this process. Cell wall biogenesis requires fusion of secretory vesicles with the PM at an about 10x higher rate than plasma membrane extension. Excess material is therefore incorporated into the plasma membrane, which needs to be reinternalized through endocytosis. The classical model of tip growth proposes that exocytosis occurs at the apex and that newly incorporated plasma membrane material is transported to adjacent lateral regions, where excess material is endocytically recycled. This model was recently challenged based on studies indicating that lateral exocytosis may be balanced by apical endocytosis. This review provides an overview of published data pertaining to exocytosis, endocytosis and vesicular trafficking in pollen tubes. Its key aim is to present classical and alternative models of tip growth in the light of available experimental data. By necessity, the review focusses on pollen tubes of angiosperm models (N. tabacum, Arabidopsis, L. longiflorum), which have been studied far more extensively and grow much faster than structurally strikingly different gymnosperm pollen tubes. Only major transport pathways are considered, which substantially contribute to the mass-flow of membrane material at the pollen tube tip. Growth oscillation, which may be displayed in particular by fast-growing pollen tubes, are not discussed as their influence on the spatial organization of apical membrane traffic is not understood.},

abstract = {Tissue patterning in multicellular organisms is the output of precise spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression coupled with changes in hormone dynamics. In plants, the hormone auxin regulates growth and development at every stage of a plant's life cycle. Auxin signaling occurs through binding of the auxin molecule to a TIR1/AFB F-box ubiquitin ligase, allowing interaction with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins. These are subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded via the 26S proteasome, leading to derepression of auxin response factors (ARFs). How auxin is able to elicit such a diverse range of developmental responses through a single signaling module has not yet been resolved. Here we present an alternative auxin-sensing mechanism in which the ARF ARF3/ETTIN controls gene expression through interactions with process-specific transcription factors. This noncanonical hormone-sensing mechanism exhibits strong preference for the naturally occurring auxin indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) and is important for coordinating growth and patterning in diverse developmental contexts such as gynoecium morphogenesis, lateral root emergence, ovule development, and primary branch formation. Disrupting this IAA-sensing ability induces morphological aberrations with consequences for plant fitness. Therefore, our findings introduce a novel transcription factor-based mechanism of hormone perception in plants.},

abstract = {The plant actin cytoskeleton is an unstable network of filaments that influences polarized growth through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we used a combination of live cell imaging and finite element computational modelling of Arabidopsis trichome morphogenesis to determine how the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons cooperate to pattern the cell wall and growth. The actin-related protein (ARP)2/3 complex generates an actin meshwork that operates within a tip-localized, microtubule-depleted zone to modulate cell wall anisotropy locally. The actin meshwork also positions an actin bundle network that organizes organelle flow patterns. This activity is required to maintain cell wall thickness gradients that enable tip-biased diffuse growth. These newly discovered couplings between cytoskeletal patterns and wall textures provide important insights into the cellular mechanism of growth control in plants. T he microtubule and actin cytoskeletons cooperate to influence shape change in both metazoan 1 and plant 2 cells. In plants, these cytoskeletal systems locally modulate the mechanical properties of the cell wall 3,4 , and in the epidermis, heterogeneities in wall texture guide the complex patterns of irreversible cell expansion 5. In leaves, these growth patterns are important because they can persist for days 6,7 and influence organ size and shape 8. Microtubule-dependent cellulose microfibril patterning is one central feature of polarized diffuse growth 9,10 ; however, the means by which the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons cooperate during cell morphogenesis is poorly understood. Leaf trichomes, specialized leaf epidermal cells that protect the growing organ against insect attack 11 , like single-celled cotton fibres 12 , are model cell types that can be used to analyse how the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons control polarized growth 13,14. The distorted Arabidopsis leaf trichome mutants identified an evolu-tionarily conserved actin filament nucleation pathway, in which the WAVE/SCAR regulatory complex (W/SRC) 15 positively regulates the actin filament nucleator ARP2/3 16-18. Although it is known that W/SRC-ARP2/3 is required to maintain organized actin bundle networks and polarized cell elongation 13,17,19-21 , the mechanisms by which it influences the cell wall properties that determine the growth behaviours of the cell are not known. Here we integrate live cell imaging and computational analyses of the cell wall to determine how an ARP2/3-generated apical actin meshwork influences cell wall properties that define the geometry of shape change. Creation of a plausible finite element model Branch elongation and tip refinement are defining features of trichome morphogenesis 13 , but at present there are no clear hypotheses about what combinations of cell wall mechanical properties would be needed to generate this type of shape change. Finite element computational modelling is a useful framework to simulate the complex relationships between turgor pressure, cell wall mechanical properties and growth 4. To parameterize a finite element model of the cell wall and branch elongation, we conducted a series of reflected light time-lapse imaging experiments (Supplementary},

abstract = {Proliferation of dispersed plant cells in culture is strictly dependent on cell density, and cells in a low-density culture can only grow in the presence of conditioned medium (CM). No known plant hormones have been able to substitute for CM. To quantify the mitogenic activity of CM, we examined conditions for the assay system using mechanically dispersed mesophyll cells of Asparagus officinalis L. and established a highly sensitive bioassay method. By use of this method, the mitogenic activity of CM prepared from asparagus cells was characterized: it was heat-stable, susceptible to pronase digestion, and resistant to glycosidase treatment. On the basis of these results, the mitogenic activity in CM was purified 10(7)-fold by column chromatography, and two factors named phytosulfokine-alpha and -beta (PSK-alpha and PSK-beta) were obtained. By amino acid sequence analysis and mass spectrometry, the structures of these two factors were determined to be sulfated pentapeptide (H-Tyr(SO3H)-Ile-Tyr(SO3H)-Thr-Gln-OH) and sulfated tetrapeptide (H-Tyr(SO3H)-Ile-Tyr(SO3H)-Thr-OH). PSK-alpha and PSK-beta were prepared by chemical synthesis and enzymatic sulfation. The synthetic peptides exhibited the same activity as the natural factors, confirming the structure for PSK-alpha and PSK-beta mentioned above. This is the first elucidation of the structure of a conditioned medium factor required for the growth of low-density plant cell cultures.},

abstract = {The plant hormone auxin promotes cell expansion. Forty years ago, the acid growth theory was proposed, whereby auxin promotes proton efflux to acidify the apoplast and facilitate the uptake of solutes and water to drive plant cell expansion. However, the underlying molecular and genetic bases of this process remain unclear. We have previously shown that the SAUR19-24 subfamily of auxin-induced SMALL AUXIN UP-RNA (SAUR) genes promotes cell expansion. Here, we demonstrate that SAUR proteins provide a mechanistic link between auxin and plasma membrane H+-ATPases (PM H+-ATPases) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants overexpressing stabilized SAUR19 fusion proteins exhibit increased PM H+-ATPase activity, and the increased growth phenotypes conferred by SAUR19 overexpression are dependent upon normal PM H+-ATPase function. We find that SAUR19 stimulates PM H+-ATPase activity by promoting phosphorylation of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain. Additionally, we identify a regulatory mechanism by which SAUR19 modulates PM H+-ATPase phosphorylation status. SAUR19 as well as additional SAUR proteins interact with the PP2C-D subfamily of type 2C protein phosphatases. We demonstrate that these phosphatases are inhibited upon SAUR binding, act antagonistically to SAURs in vivo, can physically interact with PM H+-ATPases, and negatively regulate PM H+-ATPase activity. Our findings provide a molecular framework for elucidating auxin-mediated control of plant cell expansion. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Auxin regulates a vast array of growth and developmental processes throughout the life cycle of plants. Auxin responses are highly context dependent and can involve changes in cell division, cell expansion, and cell fate. The complexity of the auxin response is illustrated by the recent finding that the auxin-responsive gene set differs significantly between different cell types in the root. Auxin regulation of transcription involves a core pathway consisting of the TIR1/AFB F-box proteins, the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, and the ARF transcription factors. Auxin is perceived by a transient coreceptor complex consisting of a TIR1/AFB protein and an Aux/IAA protein. Auxin binding to the coreceptor results in degradation of the Aux/IAAs and derepression of ARF-based transcription. Although the basic outlines of this pathway are now well established, it remains unclear how specificity of the pathway is conferred. However, recent results, focusing on the ways that these three families of proteins interact, are starting to provide important clues.},

abstract = {The vesicle trafficking inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) changes the localization of plasma membrane localized PINs, proteins that function as polar auxin efflux carriers, by inducing their accumulation within cells. Pretreatment with the synthetic auxin 1-NAA reduces this BFA-induced PIN internalization, suggesting that auxinic compounds inhibit the endocytosis of PIN proteins. However, the most important natural auxin, IAA, did not substantially inhibit PIN internalization unless a supplementary antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), was also included in the incubation medium. We asked whether the relatively small inhibition caused by IAA alone could be explained by its instability in the incubation solution or whether IAA might interact with BHT to inhibit endocytosis. Analysis of the IAA concentration in the incubation solution and of DR5 reporter activity in the roots showed that IAA is both stable and active in the medium. Therefore, IAA degradation was not able to explain the inability of IAA to inhibit endocytosis. Furthermore, when applied in the absence of auxin, BHT caused a strong increase in the rate of PIN1 internalization and a weaker increase in the rate of PIN2 internalization. These increases were unaffected by the simultaneous application of IAA, further indicating that endocytosis is not inhibited by the natural auxin IAA under physiologically relevant conditions. Endocytosis was inhibited at the same rate with 2-NAA, an inactive auxin analog, as was observed with 1-NAA and more strongly than with natural auxins, supporting the idea that this inhibition is not auxin specific.},

abstract = {It has long been hypothesized that cortical microtubules (MTs) control the orientation of cellulose microfibril deposition, but no mutants with alterations of MT orientation have been shown to affect this process. We have shown previously that in Arabidopsis, the fra2 mutation causes aberrant cortical MT orientation and reduced cell elongation, and the gene responsible for the fra2 mutation encodes a katanin-like protein. In this study, using field emission scanning electron microscopy, we found that the fra2 mutation altered the normal orientation of cellulose microfibrils in walls of expanding cells. Although cellulose microfibrils in walls of wild-type cells were oriented transversely along the elongation axis, cellulose microfibrils in walls of fra2 cells often formed bands and ran in different directions. The fra2 mutation also caused aberrant deposition of cellulose microfibrils in secondary walls of fiber cells. The aberrant orientation of cellulose microfibrils was shown to be correlated with disorganized cortical MTs in several cell types examined. In addition, the thickness of both primary and secondary cell walls was reduced significantly in the fra2 mutant. These results indicate that the katanin-like protein is essential for oriented cellulose microfibril deposition and normal cell wall biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that the Arabidopsis katanin-like protein possessed MT-severing activity in vitro; thus, it is an ortholog of animal katanin. We propose that the aberrant MT orientation caused by the mutation of katanin results in the distorted deposition of cellulose microfibrils, which in turn leads to a defect in cell elongation. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that cortical MTs regulate the oriented deposition of cellulose microfibrils that determines the direction of cell elongation.},

In Arabidopsis xylem vessels, ROP11 GTPase locally inhibits cell wall deposition through microtubule disassembly, inducing pits in cell walls. Here, we show that an additional ROP signaling pathway promotes cell wall growth at pit boundaries. Two proteins, Boundary of ROP domain1 (BDR1) and Wallin (WAL), localize to pit boundaries and regulate cell wall growth. WAL interacts with F-actin and promotes actin assembly at pit boundaries while BDR1 is a ROP effector. BDR1 interacts with WAL, suggesting that WAL could be recruited to the plasma membrane by a ROP-dependent mechanism. These results demonstrate that BDR1 and WAL mediate a ROP-actin pathway that shapes pit boundaries. The study reveals a distinct machinery in which two closely associated ROP pathways oppositely regulate cell wall deposition patterns for the establishment of tiny but highly specialized cell wall domains.},

Most of the mutants obtained selectively are also morphologically abnormal. The mutants are heterogeneous in their responses to auxin and cytokinin, and the behaviour of some is consistent with their being unable to make auxin, while that of others may be due to their being unable to synthesize cytokinin. Physiological analysis of the mutants has shown that both endogenous auxin and cytokinin are likely to play important and interdependent roles in several steps of gametophytic development. Although their morphological abnormalities lead to sterility, genetic analysis of some of the mutants has been possible by polyethyleneglycol induced proto-plast fusion.},

abstract = {Plant cells are embedded within cell walls, which provide structural integrity, but also spatially constrain cells, and must therefore be modified to allow cellular expansion. The long-standing acid growth theory postulates that auxin triggers apoplast acidification, thereby activating cell wall-loosening enzymes that enable cell expansion in shoots. Interestingly, this model remains heavily debated in roots, because of both the complex role of auxin in plant development as well as technical limitations in investigating apoplastic pH at cellular resolution. Here, we introduce 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) as a suitable fluorescent pH indicator for assessing apoplastic pH, and thus acid growth, at a cellular resolution in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Using HPTS, we demonstrate that cell wall acidification triggers cellular expansion,which is correlated with a preceding increase of auxin signaling. Reduction in auxin levels, perception, or signaling abolishes both the extracellular acidification and cellular expansion. These findings jointly suggest that endogenous auxin controls apoplastic acidification and the onset of cellular elongation in roots. In contrast, an endogenous or exogenous increase in auxin levels induces a transient alkalinization of the extracellular matrix, reducing cellular elongation. The receptor-like kinase FERONIA is required for this physiological process, which affects cellular root expansion during the gravitropic response. These findings pinpoint a complex, presumably concentrationdependent role for auxin in apoplastic pH regulation, steering the rate of root cell expansion and gravitropic response.},

We performed a pharmacological approach using $\alpha$-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (auxinole), $\alpha$-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of ABP1 , abp1-c1 and abp1-TD1 , and the TILLING mutant abp1-5 . We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like swelling response. In the ABP1 -related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.

abstract = {Cell polarity is the ultimate reflection of complex mecha- nisms that establish and maintain functionally special- ized domains in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The spatial arrangement and protein composition of these domains facilitate cellular processes as diverse as differentiation, localized membrane growth, activa- tion of the immune response, directional cell migration, and vectorial transport of molecules across cell layers. In this review, two phylogenetically distant eukaryotic cells, budding yeast and mammalian epithelial cells, are examined to highlight advances in our understanding of how cell polarity is established. Both of these cells are characterizedby a highdegree of cellular asymmetry (see Figure 1) and have been used extensively to study how cell polarity is developed. The specific focus here is on the molecular nature of the intrinsic and extrinsic spatial cues that establish structural and molecular asymmetry at the cell surface, the mechanisms that in- terpret signals from these cues to generate new mem- brane domains, andthe reorganization of thecell around these spatially defined sites (see Figure 2). Theevidence supports a model in which a hierarchy of three sequen- tial stages is required to establish cell polarity from a spatial cue (see Figure 3). This hierarchy consists of the following: marking a site and decoding the cue; reinforc- ing the cue; propagating the cue. Feedback regulation at each stage coordinates and reinforces the proper ordering of these events, resulting in the maintenance of cell polarity. Eachlevel of this hierarchy is colorcoded and epithelial cells. Because these two cell types are separated by a large phylogenetic distance, the similar- ity of stages suggests that mechanisms used for impos- ing cell polarity might be quite general.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis in plants arises from the interplay of genetic and physical interactions within a growing network of cells. The physical aspects of cell proliferation and differentiation are genetically regulated, but constrained by mechanical interactions between the cells. Higher plant tissues consist of an elaborate three-dimensional matrix of active cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, where it is difficult to obtain direct measurements of geometry or cell interactions. To properly understand the workings of plant morphogenesis, it is necessary to have biological systems that allow simple and direct observation of these processes. We have adopted a highly simplified plant system to investigate how cell proliferation and expansion is coordinated during morphogenesis. Coleocheate scutata is a microscopic fresh-water green alga with simple anatomical features that allow for accurate quantification of morphogenetic processes. Image analysis techniques were used to extract precise models for cell geometry and physical parameters for growth. This allowed construction of a deformable finite element model for growth of the whole organism, which incorporated cell biophysical properties, viscous expansion of cell walls, and rules for regulation of cell behavior. The study showed that a simple set of autonomous, cell-based rules are sufficient to account for the morphological and dynamic properties of Coleochaete growth.

abstract = {Auxin functions as a key morphogen in regulating plant growth and development. Studies on auxin-regulated gene expression and on the mechanism of polar auxin transport and its asymmetric distribution within tissues have provided the basis for realizing the molecular mechanisms underlying auxin function. In eukaryotes, members of the Ras and Rho subfamilies of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases function as molecular switches in many signaling cascades that regulate growth and development. Plants do not have Ras proteins, but they contain Rho-like small G proteins called RACs or ROPs that, like fungal and metazoan Rhos, are regulators of cell polarity and may also undertake some Ras functions. Here, we discuss the advances made over the last decade that implicate RAC/ROPs as mediators for auxin-regulated gene expression, rapid cell surface-located auxin signaling, and directional auxin transport. We also describe experimental data indicating that auxin-RAC/ROP crosstalk may form regulatory feedback loops and theoretical modeling that attempts to connect local auxin gradients with RAC/ROP regulation of cell polarity. We hope that by discussing these experimental and modeling studies, this perspective will stimulate efforts to further refine our understanding of auxin signaling via the RAC/ ROP molecular switch. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

However, it has remained unclear how auxin can simultaneously regulate patterning and organ outgrowth and how its distribution is stabilized in a primordium-specif ic manner. Here we show that five PIN genes collectively control auxin distribution to regulate cell division and cell expansion in the primary root. Furthermore, the joint action of these genes has an important role in pattern formation by focusing the auxin maximum and restricting the expression domain of PLETHORA (PLT) genes, major determinants for root stem cell specification. In turn, PLT genes are required for PIN gene transcription to stabilize the auxin maximum at the distal root tip. Our data reveal an interaction network of auxin transport facilitators and root fate determinants that control patterning and growth of the root primordium.},

Previous attempts to predict division planes from cell geometry in plants mostly focused on 2D symmetric divisions. Using the stereotyped division patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana early embryogenesis, we investigated geometrical principles underlying plane selection in symmetric and in asymmetric divisions within complex 3D cell shapes. Introducing a 3D computational model of cell division, we show that area minimization constrained on passing through the cell centroid predicts observed divisions. Our results suggest that the positioning of division planes ensues from cell geometry and gives rise to spatially organized cell types with stereotyped shapes, thus underlining the role of self-organization in the developing architecture of the embryo. Our data further suggested the rule could be interpreted as surface minimization constrained by the nucleus position, which was validated using live imaging of cell divisions in the stomatal cell lineage.

Much less is known regarding its role in plant cell differentiation.

The $\gamma$-tubulin complex and the katanin complex play central roles in the organization of plant cortical microtubules [2–6]. Previously, we reported that the augmin complex recruits the $\gamma$-tubulin complex to preexisting microtubules and initiates microtubule nucleation [7]. Moreover, we described how an intricate interaction between the katanin p60 subunit KTN1 and the p80 subunit KTN80 confers precise microtubule severing at either microtubule branching nucleation sites or crossovers [8]. Here, we observed that augmin preferentially localizes to microtubule crossovers. Live-cell observations and analyses revealed that, whereas a small portion of crossover-localized augmin complexes act to trigger nascent microtubule nucleation, the majority function in stabilizing the architecture of microtubule crossovers. Finally, genetic analyses and computational modeling confirmed that suppression of augmin activity elevates microtubule severing frequency and facilitates the formation of aligned microtubule arrays. Combined, our findings reveal an unexpected role of augmin and demonstrate that augmin antagonizes katanin-mediated microtubule severing. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism for how augmin determines self-organization of plant cortical microtubules by preventing microtubule severing at crossovers in addition to triggering microtubule nucleation. Wang et al. reveal an unexpected role of augmin in maintaining the stability of MT crossovers. They uncover a novel mechanism for how crossover-localized augmin primarily regulates self-organization of plant cortical MTs by preventing MT severing at crossovers.},

COPI-coated buds primarily reside on the cis-face of the Golgi stack. In addition, COPI and Arf1p show predominant labeling of the cis-Golgi stack, gradually diminishing toward the trans-Golgi stack. In vitro COPI-coated vesicle induction experiments demonstrated that Arf1p as well as coatomer could be recruited from cauliflower cytosol onto mixed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi membranes. Binding of Arf1p and coatomer is inhibited by brefeldin A, underlining the specificity of the recruitment mechanism. In vitro vesicle budding was confirmed by identification of COPI-coated vesicles through immunogold negative staining in a fraction purified from isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation.

abstract = {One key aspect of cell division in multicellular organisms is the orientation of the division plane. Proper division plane establishment contributes to normal organization of the plant body. To determine the importance of cell geometry in division plane orientation, we designed a three-dimensional probabilistic mathematical modeling approach to directly test the century-old hypothesis that cell divisions mimic soap-film minima or that daughter cells have equal volume and the resulting division plane is a local surface area minimum. Predicted division planes were compared to a plant microtubule array that marks the division site, the preprophase band (PPB). PPB location typically matched one of the predicted divisions. Predicted divisions offset from the PPB occurred when a neighboring cell wall or PPB was observed directly adjacent to the predicted division site, potentially to avoid creating a structurally unfavorable four-way junction. By comparing divisions of differently shaped plant and animal cells to divisions simulated in silico, we demonstrate the generality of this model to accurately predict in vivo division. This powerful model can be used to separate the contribution of geometry from mechanical stresses or developmental regulation in predicting division plane orientation.},

A NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3 (NPH3)-like protein, MACCHI-BOU 4 (MAB4), has been shown to control PIN1 localization during organ formation, but its contribution is limited. The Arabidopsis genome contains four genes, MAB4/ENP/NPY1-LIKE1 (MEL1), MEL2, MEL3 and MEL4, highly homologous to MAB4. Genetic analysis disclosed functional redundancy between MAB4 and MEL genes in regulation of not only organ formation but also of root gravitropism, revealing that NPH3 family proteins have a wider range of functions than previously suspected. Multiple mutants showed severe reduction in PIN abundance and PIN polar localization, leading to defective expression of an auxin responsive marker DR5rev::GFP. Pharmacological analyses and fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching experiments showed that mel mutations increase PIN2 internalization from the plasma membrane, but affect neither intracellular PIN2 trafficking nor PIN2 lateral diffusion at the plasma membrane. Notably, all MAB4 subfamily proteins show polar localization at the cell periphery in plants. The MAB4 polarity was almost identical to PIN polarity. Our results suggest that the MAB4 subfamily proteins specifically retain PIN proteins in a polarized manner at the plasma membrane, thus controlling directional auxin transport and plant development.},

Very few attempts have been made to enhance stomatal opening with the goal of increasing photosynthesis and plant growth, even though stomatal resistance is thought to be the major limiting factor for CO2 uptake by plants.

abstract = {s Abstract Pollen tubes and root hairs are highly elongated, cylindrically shaped cells whose polarized growth permits them to explore the environment for the benefit of the entire plant. Root hairs create an enormous surface area for the uptake of water and nutrients, whereas pollen tubes deliver the sperm cells to the ovule for fertilization. These cells grow exclusively at the apex and at prodigious rates (in excess of 200 nm/s for pollen tubes). Underlying this rapid growth are polarized ion gradients and fluxes, turnover of cytoskeletal elements (actin microfilaments), and exocytosis and endocy-tosis of membrane vesicles. Intracellular gradients of calcium and protons are spatially localized at the growing apex; inward fluxes of these ions are apically directed. These gradients and fluxes oscillate with the same frequency as the oscillations in growth rate but not with the same phase. Actin microfilaments, which together with myosin generate reverse fountain streaming, undergo rapid turnover in the apical domain, possibly being regulated by key actin-binding proteins, e.g., profilin, villin, and ADF/cofilin, in concert with the ion gradients. Exocytosis of vesicles at the apex, also dependent on the ion gradients, provides precursor material for the continuously expanding cell wall of the growing cell. Elucidation of the interactions and of the dynamics of these different components is providing unique insight into the mechanisms of polarized growth.},

Cucumber leaf shapes are diverse; however, the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying leaf shape formation are unknown. In this study, we obtained a round leaf mutant (rl) from an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutagenesis population. Genetic analysis revealed that a single recessive gene, rl, is responsible for this mutation. A modified MutMap analysis combined linkage mapping identified a single nucleotide polymorphism within a candidate gene, Csa1M537400, as the mutation underlying the trait. Csa1M537400 encodes a PINOID kinase protein involved in auxin transport. Expression of Csa1M537400 was significantly lower in the rl mutant than in wild type, and it displayed higher levels of IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) in several tissues. Treatment of wild-type plants with an auxin transport inhibitor induced the formation of round leaves, similar to those in the rl mutant. Altered expression patterns of several auxin-related genes in the rl mutant suggest that rl plays a key role in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and response in cucumber. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of auxin signaling pathways in cucumber, and will be valuable in the development of an ideal plant type.},

We first identified genes that are expressed downstream of VND6 but not downstream of SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN1 (SND1), a master regulator of xylem fiber cells, using transformed suspension culture cells in microarray experiments. We found that VND6 and SND1 governed distinct aspects of xylem formation, whereas they regulated a number of genes in common, specifically those related to secondary cell wall formation. Genes involved in TE-specific PCD were upregulated only by VND6. Moreover, we revealed that VND6 directly regulated genes that harbor a TE-specific cis-element, TERE, in their promoters. Thus, we found that VND6 is a direct regulator of genes related to PCD as well as to secondary wall formation.},

In the moss Physcomitrella patens, 3D growth (gametophores) is preceded by an extended 2-dimensional (2D) growth phase (protonemata) that can be propagated indefinitely. Studies using P. patens have thus elucidated some of the molecular mechanisms underlying 3D growth regulation. This review summarizes the known molecular mechanisms underlying both the formation of gametophore initial cells and the development of the 3D growth in gametophores.},

Here, we identify the PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2 genes encoding AP2 class putative transcription factors, which are essential for QC specification and stem cell activity. The PLT genes are transcribed in response to auxin accumulation and are dependent on auxin response transcription factors. Distal PLT transcript accumulation creates an overlap with the radial expression domains of SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW, providing positional information for the stem cell niche. Furthermore, the PLT genes are activated in the basal embryo region that gives rise to hypocotyl, root, and root stem cells and, when ectopically expressed, transform apical regions to these identities. Thus, the PLT genes are key effectors for establishment of the stem cell niche during embryonic pattern formation.},

abstract = {Auxin-response factors (ARFs) bind with specificity to TGTCTC auxin-response elements (AuxREs), which are found in promoters of primary/early auxin-response genes. Nine different ARFs have been analyzed for their capacity to activate or repress transcription in transient expression assays employing auxin-responsive GUS reporter genes. One ARF appears to act as a repressor. Four ARFs function as activators and contain glutamine-rich activation domains. To achieve transcriptional activation on TGTCTC AuxREs in transient expression assays, ARFs require a conserved dimerization domain found in both ARF and Aux/IAA proteins, but they do not absolutely require their DNA-binding domains. Our results suggest that ARFs can activate or repress transcription by binding to AuxREs directly and that selected ARFs, when overexpressed, may potentiate activation further by associating with an endogenous transcription factor(s) (e.g., an ARF) that is bound to AuxREs. Transfection experiments suggest that TGTCTC AuxREs are occupied regardless of the auxin status in cells and that these occupied AuxREs are activated when exogenous auxin is applied to cells or when ARF activators are overexpressed. The results provide new insight into mechanisms involved with auxin regulation of primary/early-response genes.},

abstract = {Mediator is a multiprotein complex that integrates the signals from transcription factors binding to the promoter and transmits them to achieve gene transcription. The subunits of Mediator complex reside in four modules: the head, middle, tail, and dissociable CDK8 kinase module (CKM). The head, middle, and tail modules form the core Mediator complex, and the association of CKM can modify the function of Mediator in transcription. Here, we show genetic and biochemical evidence that CKM-associated Mediator transmits auxin-dependent transcriptional repression in lateral root (LR) formation. The AUXIN/INDOLE 3-ACETIC ACID 14 (Aux/IAA14) transcriptional repressor inhibits the transcriptional activity of its binding partners AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19 by making a complex with the CKM-associated Mediator. In addition, TOPLESS (TPL), a transcriptional corepressor, forms a bridge between IAA14 and the CKM component MED13 through the physical interaction. ChIP assays show that auxin induces the dissociation of MED13 but not the tail module component MED25 from the ARF7 binding region upstream of its target gene. These findings indicate that auxin-induced degradation of IAA14 changes the module composition of Mediator interacting with ARF7 and ARF19 in the upstream region of their target genes involved in LR formation. We suggest that this regulation leads to a quick switch of signal transmission from ARFs to target gene expression in response to auxin.},

abstract = {To explore the role of auxin-binding protein (ABP1) in planta, a number of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) lines were generated. The wild-type KDEL endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal was mutated to HDEL, another common retention sequence in plants, and to KEQL or KDELGL to compromise its activity. The auxin-binding kinetics of these forms of ABP1 were found to be similar to those of ABP1 purified from maize (Zea mays). To test for a physiological response mediated by auxin, intact guard cells of the transgenic plants were impaled with double-barreled microelectrodes, and auxin-dependent changes in K+ currents were recorded under voltage clamp. Exogenous auxin affected inwardly and outwardly rectifying K+ currents in a dose-dependent manner. Auxin sensitivity was markedly enhanced in all plants overexpressing ABP1, irrespective of the form present. Immunogold electron microscopy was used to investigate the localization of ABP1 in the transgenic plants. All forms were detected in the endoplasmic reticulum and the KEQL and KDELGL forms passed further across the Golgi stacks than KDEL and HDEL forms. However, neither electron microscopy nor silver-enhanced immunogold epipolarization microscopy revealed differences in cell surface ABP1 abundance for any of the plants, including control plants, which indicated that overexpression of ABP1 alone was sufficient to confer increased sensitivity to added auxin. Jones et al. ([1998] Science 282: 1114-1117) found increased cell expansion in transgenic plants overexpressing wild-type ABP1. Single cell recordings extend this observation, with the demonstration that the auxin sensitivity of guard cell K+ currents is mediated, at least in part, by ABP1.},

abstract = {Glutamate receptors are well characterized channels that mediate cell-to-cell communication during neurotransmission in animals, but their functional role in organisms without a nervous system remains unclear. In plants, genes of the GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) family have been implicated in defence against pathogens, reproduction, control of stomata aperture and light signal transduction 1-5. However, the large number of GLR genes present in angiosperm genomes (20 to 70) 6 has prevented the observation of strong phenotypes in loss-of-function mutants. Here we show that in the basal land plant Physcomitrella patens, mutation of the GLR genes GLR1 and GLR2 causes failure of sperm cells to target the female reproductive organs. In addition, we show that GLR genes encode non-selective Ca 2+-permeable channels that can regulate cytoplasmic Ca 2+ and are needed to induce the expression of a BELL1-like transcription factor essential for zygote development. Our work reveals functions for GLR channels in sperm chemotaxis and transcriptional regulation. Sperm chemotaxis is essential for fertilization in both animals and early land plants such as bryophytes and pteridophytes. Therefore, our results suggest that ionotropic glutamate receptors may have been conserved throughout plant evolution to mediate cell-to-cell communication during sexual reproduction. Only two GLR genes have been identified in the moss Physcomitrella 7 , and phylogenetic analyses showed that these genes are paralogues to Arabidopsis clade three 8. As a first approach to determine the function of GLR genes in mosses, we complemented our previous transcrip-tomic analysis 9 to profile the expression of P. patens GLR1 and GLR2. We purified mRNA from all tissues including archegonia, sperm cells and sporophytes isolated at three different developmental stages, and monitored GLR1 and GLR2 expression by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig. 1). GLR1 transcript was detected in all tissues, with the highest expression in gametophores and young sporophytes. By contrast, GLR2 has a very specific expression pattern that is limited to archegonia, sperm cells and mature sporophytes (Fig. 1a), suggestive of a role in sexual reproduction. We then progressed to loss-of-function studies by generating single-and double-knockout mutants by homologous recombination (glr1-19, glr2-11; double mutant line referred as glr1/2). Early developmental stages are characterized by the presence of haploid tip growing cells (caulonema and chloronema), and none of our mutant lines displayed any phenotypic defects in these cell types. Even when exposed to low Ca 2+ conditions, growth was comparable between wild-type lines and glr1/2 mutants (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This was unexpected since GLR mutations in Arabidopsis produced tip growth defects in pollen tubes 4. Because caulonema filaments are the most active tip-growing cells in Physcomitrella, we preferentially induced their development to test whether tip growth was impaired in glr1/2 mutants. However, caulonema cells grew normally (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c), suggesting that GLR function in apical growth is not conserved between angio-sperms and bryophytes. Importantly, in Arabidopsis glr mutants, pollen tube growth defects lead to male reproductive phenotypes 4. Having this in mind and considering the transcriptomic profile of P. patens GLR2, we decided to investigate further whether P. patens GLR genes had a conserved role in reproduction. We induced the development of reproductive structures (gametangia) and quantified the production of sporophytes (the diploid zygotic structure) as a way to assess fertilization rates indirectly. Under our conditions, 56.3 ± 11{\%} (mean ± s.d., unless otherwise specified) of wild-type gametophores develop mature sporophytes after 6 weeks of induction (Fig. 1c). Notably, all P. patens glr mutant lines produced far fewer sporophytes than wild-type lines (Fig. 1b). The percentage of gametophores with sporophytes in glr1 decreased to 33 ± 7{\%} and was even more severe in glr2 and glr1/2 double-knockout lines, with 17.9 ± 3.9{\%} and 10.2 ± 6.2{\%}, respectively. Furthermore, the few spo-rophytes produced by the mutant lines showed delayed maturation (Fig. 1c), suggestive of a possible role in sporophyte developmental progression. These phenotypes cannot be attributed to defects in the formation of reproductive organs, because archegonia (organs that form the female gametes) and antheridia (the male counterpart) isolated from glr1/2 mutants show the same morphology and developmental patterns as wild-type lines (Fig. 1b). To determine the contribution of male and female gametes to the low sporophyte production rates observed in mutant lines, we carried out cross-fertilization experiments. We used transgenic lines expressing green and red fluorescent protein (GFP and RFP, respectively) as markers to discriminate between self-fertilized and hybrid sporophytes. First, we investigated whether sporophyte production rates could increase by crossing GFP-expressing wild-type plants with glr1/2 mutants. Interestingly, 33.0 ± 6.3{\%} of glr1/2 gametophores produced sporophytes, almost all of them originating from outcrossing events (hybrid sporophytes) (Fig. 1d; Table 1). This observation supports the interpretation that wild-type sperm can fertilize mutant plants. Notably, in this experimental setting, complementation depends solely on outcrossing efficiency. Therefore, as a reference we estimated natural outcrossing rates in wild-type plants and found that they were indeed similar to those reported in our first cross (Table 1). To show that glr1/2 archegonia is capable of producing sporophytes at normal rates, we crossed this line with the more efficient Physcomitrella Villersexel outcrosser strain 10 expressing RFP (referred to as Vsx RFP). As a result, sporophyte production rates in glr1/2 were even higher than wild-type lines (72.0 ± 18.9{\%}), presenting a complete phenotypic rescue (Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). We then performed the reverse crossing experiment to test whether glr1/2 sperm were incapable of achieving fertilization. We found that outcrossing rates dropped markedly when the glr1/2 mutant expressing},

abstract = {Tip-growing pollen tubes provide a useful model system to study polar growth. Although roles for tip-focused calcium gradient and tip-localized Rho-family GTPase in pollen tube growth is established, the existence and function of tip-localized F-actin have been controversial. Using the green fluorescent protein tagged actin-binding domain of mouse talin, we found a dynamic form of tip-localized F-actin in tobacco pollen tubes, termed short actin bundles (SABs). The dynamics of SABs during polar growth in pollen tubes is regulated by Rop1At, a Rop GTPase belonging to the Rho family. When overexpressed, Rop1At transformed SAB into a network of fine filaments and induced a transverse actin band behind the tip, leading to depolarized growth. These changes were due to ectopic Rop1At localization to the apical region of the plasma membrane and were suppressed by guanine dissocia-tion inhibitor overexpression, which removed ectopi-cally localized Rop1At. Rop GTPase-activating protein (RopGAP1) overexpression, or Latrunculin B treatments, also recovered normal actin organization and tip growth in Rop1At-overexpressing tubes. Moreover , overexpression of RopGAP1 alone disrupted SABs and inhibited growth. Finally, SAB oscillates and appears at the tip before growth. Together, these results indicate that the dynamics of tip actin are essential for tip growth and provide the first direct evidence to link Rho GTPase to actin organization in controlling cell polarity and polar growth in plants.},

abstract = {Plant cells have evolved cortical microtubules, in a two-dimensional space beneath the plasma membrane [1, 2], that regulate patterning of cellulose deposition [3]. Although recent studies have revealed that several microtubule-associated proteins [4–8] facilitate self-organization of transverse cortical microtubules [9–11], it is still unknown how diverse patterns of cortical microtubules are organized in different xylem cells [12–17], which are the major components of wood. Using our newly established in vitro xylem cell differentiation system, we found that a novel microtubule end-tracking protein, microtubule depletion domain 1 (MIDD1), was anchored to distinct plasma membrane domains and promoted local microtubule disassembly, resulting in pits on xylem cell walls. The introduction of RNA interference for MIDD1 resulted in the failure of local microtubule depletion and the formation of secondary walls without pits. Conversely, the overexpression of MIDD1 reduced microtubule density. MIDD1 has two coiled-coil domains for the binding to microtubules and for the anchorage to plasma membrane domains, respectively. Combination of the two coils caused end tracking of microtubules during shrinkage and suppressed their rescue events. Our results indicate that MIDD1 integrates spatial information in the plasma membrane with cortical microtubule dynamics for determining xylem cell wall pattern.},

The existence of membrane microdomains, meanwhile, has been verified by unequivocal independent evidence. This review summarizes the current state of research in plants and fungi with respect to common aspects of both kingdoms. In these organisms, principally immobile microdomains large enough for microscopic detection have been visualized. These microdomains are found in the context of cell-cell interactions (plant symbionts and pathogens), membrane transport, stress, and polarized growth, and the data corroborate at least three mechanisms of formation.

Factors regulating plant growth, among them the hormone auxin, have been recognized as regulators of microtubule array orientations. Some previous work in the field has aimed at elucidating the causal relationship between cell growth, the signaling of auxin or other growth-regulating factors, and microtubule array reorientations, with various conclusions. Here, we revisit this problem of causality with a comprehensive set of experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana, using the now available pharmacological and genetic tools. We use isolated, auxin-depleted hypocotyls, an experimental system allowing for full control of both growth and auxin signaling. We demonstrate that reorientation of microtubules is not directly triggered by an auxin signal during growth activation. Instead, reorientation is triggered by the activation of the growth process itself and is auxin-independent in its nature. We discuss these findings in the context of previous relevant work, including that on the mechanical regulation of microtubule array orientation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We investigated the short day (SD)-induced transition to dormancy in wild-type hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides) and its absence in transgenic poplar overexpressing heterologous PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA). CENTRORADIALIS-LIKE1 (CENL1), a poplar ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1), was markedly downregulated in the wild-type apex coincident with SD-induced growth cessation. By contrast, poplar overexpressing a heterologous Avena sativa PHYA construct (P35S:AsPHYA), with PHYA accumulating in the rib meristem (RM) and adjacent tissues but not in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), upregulated CENL1 in the RM area coincident with an acceleration of stem elongation. In SD-exposed heterografts, both P35S:AsPHYA and wild-type scions ceased growth and formed buds, whereas only the wild type assumed dormancy and P35S:AsPHYA showed repetitive flushing. This shows that the transition is not dictated by leaf-produced signals but dependent on RM and SAM properties. In view of this, callose-enforced cell isolation in the SAM, associated with suspension of indeterminate growth during dormancy, may require downregulation of CENL1 in the RM. Accordingly, upregulation of CENL1/TFL1 might promote stem elongation in poplar as well as in Arabidopsis during bolting. Together, the results suggest that the RM is particularly sensitive to photoperiodic signals and that CENL1 in the RM influences transition to dormancy in hybrid poplar. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract = {Cell polarity, often associated with polarized cell expansion/growth in plants, describes the uneven distribution of cellular components, such as proteins, nucleic acids, signaling molecules, vesicles, cytoskeletal elements and organelles, which may ultimately modulate cell shape, structure and function. Pollen tubes and root hairs are model cell systems for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying sustained tip growth. The formation of intercalated epidermal pavement cells requires excitatory and inhibitory pathways to coordinate cell expansion within single cells and between cells in contact. Strictly controlled cell expansion is linked to asymmetric cell division in zygotes and stomatal lineages, which require integrated processes of pre-mitotic cellular polarization and division asymmetry. While small GTPases ROPs are recognized as fundamental signaling switches for cell polarity in various cellular and developmental processes in plants, the broader molecular machinery underpinning asymmetric division-required polarity establishment remain largely unknown. Here, we review the widely used ROP signaling pathways in cell polar growth and the recently discovered feedback loops with auxin signaling and PIN effluxers. We discuss the conserved phosphorylation and phospholipid signaling mechanisms for protein uneven distribution, as well as the potential roles of novel proteins and MAPKs in the polarity establishment related to asymmetric cell division in plants. Short Summary Establishing cell polarity is required for many developmental processes in plants, including sustained tip extension (pollen tubes and root hairs), diffuse cell growth (pavement cells) and regional cell expansion for asymmetric cell division (zygotes and stomatal lineages). We summarize the small GTPases-centered molecular mechanisms underpinning plant cell polarity and discuss the potential roles of other signaling pathways in asymmetric cell expansion.},

Here we show that the CysPc-C2L domains of land plant calpains form a separate sub-clade in the DEK1 clade of the phylogenetic tree of plants. The charophycean alga Mesostigma viride DEK1-like gene is clearly divergent from those in land plants, suggesting that a major evolutionary shift in DEK1 occurred during the transition to land plants. Based on genetic complementation of the Arabidopsis thaliana dek1-3 mutant using CysPc-C2L domains of various origins, we show that these two domains have been functionally conserved within land plants for at least 450 million years. This conclusion is based on the observation that the CysPc-C2L domains of DEK1 from the moss Physcomitrella patens complements the A. thaliana dek1-3 mutant phenotype. In contrast, neither the CysPc-C2L domains from M. viride nor chimeric animal-plant calpains complement this mutant. Co-evolution analysis identified differences in the interactions between the CysPc-C2L residues of DEK1 and classical calpains, supporting the view that the two enzymes are regulated by fundamentally different mechanisms. Using the A. thaliana dek1-3 complementation assay, we show that four conserved amino acid residues of two Ca²⁺-binding sites in the CysPc domain of classical calpains are conserved in land plants and functionally essential in A. thaliana DEK1.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The coordinated action of the auxin-sensitive Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and ARF transcription factors produces complex gene-regulatory networks in plants. Despite their importance, our knowledge of these two protein families is largely based on analysis of stabilized forms of the Aux/IAAs, and studies of a subgroup of ARFs that function as transcriptional activators. To understand how auxin regulates gene expression we generated a Physcomitrella patens line that completely lacks Aux/IAAs. Loss of the repressors causes massive changes in transcription with misregulation of over a third of the annotated genes. Further, we find that the aux/iaa mutant is blind to auxin indicating that auxin regulation of transcription occurs exclusively through Aux/IAA function. We used the aux/iaa mutant as a simplified platform for studies of ARF function and demonstrate that repressing ARFs regulate auxin-induced genes and fine-tune their expression. Further the repressing ARFs coordinate gene induction jointly with activating ARFs and the Aux/IAAs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) of higher plants plays an essential role in position-dependent signaling and consists of a large transmembrane domain (MEM) linked to a protease catalytic domain and a regulatory domain. Here, we show that the postulated sensory Loop of the MEM domain plays an important role in the developmental regulation of DEK1 activity in the moss Physcomitrella patens. Compared with P. patens lacking DEK1 (∆dek1), the dek1∆loop mutant correctly positions the division plane in the bud apical cell. In contrast with an early developmental arrest of ∆dek1 buds, dek1∆loop develops aberrant gametophores lacking expanded phyllids resulting from misregulation of mitotic activity. In contrast with the highly conserved sequence of the protease catalytic domain, the Loop is highly variable in land plants. Functionally, the sequence from Marchantia polymorpha fully complements the dek1∆loop phenotype, whereas sequences from maize (Zea mays) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) give phenotypes with retarded growth and affected phyllid development. Bioinformatic analysis identifies MEM as a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily, membrane transporters reacting to stimuli from the external environment. Transcriptome analysis comparing wild-type and ∆dek1 tissues identifies an effect on two groups of transcripts connected to dek1 mutant phenotypes: transcripts related to cell wall remodeling and regulation of the AINTEGUMENTA, PLETHORA, and BABY BOOM2 (APB2) and APB3 transcription factors known to regulate bud initiation. Finally, sequence data support the hypothesis that the advanced charophyte algae that evolved into ancestral land plants lost cytosolic calpains, retaining DEK1 as the sole calpain in the evolving land plant lineage.},

A polarized cytoplasm with an abundance of vesicles and tip-focused Ca 2+ and H + concentration gradients are important for the polar cell growth process. Apical membrane-located Rho GTPases regulate Ca 2+ concentration and actin dynamics in the cytoplasm and are crucial for maintaining pollen tube polarity. Pollen tube growth is marked by periods of rapid and slow growth phases. Activities that regulate and support this tip growth process also show oscilla-tory fluctuations.

Our experiments reveal that both PIN1 localization and microtubule array orientation are likely to respond to a shared upstream regulator that appears to be biomechanical in nature. Lastly, through mathematical modeling we show that such a biophysical coupling could mediate the feedback loop between auxin and its transport that underlies plant phyllotaxis.},

It is one of the few derived traits specific to embryophytes, in which it is involved in the spatial control of cell division. Here we show that loss of function of Physcomitrella patens PpTON1 strongly affects development of the moss gametophore, phenocopying the developmental syndrome observed in Arabidopsis ton1 mutants: mutant leafy shoots display random orientation of cell division and severe defects in cell elongation, which are correlated with absence of PPB formation and disorganization of the cortical microtubule array in interphase cells. In hypomorphic Ppton1 alleles, PPB are still formed, whereas elongation defects are observed, showing the dual function of TON1 in organizing cortical arrays of microtubules during both interphase and premitosis. Ppton1 mutation has no impact on development of the protonema, which is consistent with the documented absence of PPB formation at this stage, apart from alteration of the gravitropic response, uncovering a new function of TON1 proteins in plants. Successful reciprocal cross-complementation between Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis shows conservation of TON1 function during land plant evolution. These results establish the essential role of the PPB in division plane specification in a basal land plant lineage, and provide new information on the function of TON1. They point to an ancient mechanism of cytoskeletal control of division plane positioning and cell elongation in land plants.},

This cellular variability occurs in normal, wild-type organisms, indicating that cellular heterogeneity (or diversity in a characteristic such as growth rate) is either actively maintained or, at a minimum, not entirely suppressed.

abstract = {Little is known about patterns of genic DNA methylation across the plant kingdom or about the evolutionary processes that shape them. To characterize gene-body methylation (gbM) within exons, we have gathered single-base resolution methy-lome data that span the phylogenetic breadth of land plants. We find that a basal land plant, Marchantia polymorpha, lacks any evident signal of gbM within exons, but conifers have high levels of both CG and CHG (where H is A, C or T) methyl-ation in expressed genes. To begin to understand the evolution-ary forces that shape gbM, we first tested for correlations in methylation levels across orthologues 1,2 . Genic CG methylation levels, but not CHG or CHH levels, are correlated across ortho-logues for species as distantly related as ferns and angios-perms. Hence, relative levels of CG methylation are a consistent property across genes, even for species that diverged ∼400 million years ago 3,4 . In contrast, genic CHG methylation correlates with genome size, suggesting that the host epigenetic response to transposable elements also affects genes. Altogether, our data indicate that the evolution-ary forces acting on DNA methylation vary substantially across species, genes and methylation contexts. Plants methylate their cytosines in three contexts: CG, CHG and CHH. The percentage of methylated cytosines (mCs) varies among these three contexts, in part because they require different mechan-isms 5 . Just as the pattern of mCs varies among contexts, it also differs among genomic regions. Repetitive regions often contain methylation marks in all three contexts, where methylation acts to silence transposable elements 6},

abstract = {Tissue-wide polarity fields, in which cell polarity is coordinated across the tissue, have been described for planar organs such as the Drosophila wing and are considered important for coordinating growth and differentiation [1]. In planar plant organs, such as leaves, polarity fields have been identified for subgroups of cells, such as stomatal lineages [2], trichomes [3, 4], serrations [5], or early developmental stages [6]. Here, we show that ectopic induction of the stomatal protein BASL (BREAKING OF ASYMMETRY IN THE STOMATAL LINEAGE) reveals a tissue-wide epidermal polarity field in leaves throughout development. Ectopic GFP-BASL is typically localized toward the proximal end of cells and to one lobe of mature pavement cells, revealing a polarity field that aligns with the proximodistal axis of the leaf (base to tip). The polarity field is largely parallel to the midline of the leaf but diverges in more lateral positions, particularly at later stages in development, suggesting it may be deformed during growth. The polarity field is observed in the speechless mutant, showing that it is independent of stomatal lineages, and is observed in isotropic cells, showing that cell shape anisotropy is not required for orienting polarity. Ectopic BASL forms convergence and divergence points at serrations, mirroring epidermal PIN polarity patterns, suggesting a common underlying polarity mechanism. Thus, we show that similar to the situation in animals, planar plant organs have a tissue-wide cell polarity field, and this may provide a general cellular mechanism for guiding growth and differentiation. Mansfield et al. demonstrate a coordinated tissue cell polarity field in the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis revealed by ectopic expression of BASL. This polarity field is independent of the stomatal lineage and reorients around serrations, mirroring the polarity of PIN1.},

abstract = {A significant feature of plant cells is the extensive motility of organelles and the cytosol, which was originally defined as cytoplasmic streaming. We suggested previously that a three-way interaction between plant-specific motor proteins myosin XIs, actin filaments, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was responsible for cytoplasmic streaming. 1 Currently, however, there are no reports of molecular components for cytoplasmic streaming other than the actin-myosin-cytoskeleton and ER-related proteins. In the present study, we found that elongated cells of inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibit vigorous cytoplasmic streaming. Statistical analysis showed that the maximal velocity of plastid movements is 7.26 mm/s, which is much faster than the previously reported velocities of organelles. Surprisingly, the maximal velocity of streaming in the inflorescence stem cells was significantly reduced to 1.11 mm/s in an Arabidopsis mutant, abcb19-101, which lacks ATP BINDING CASSETTE SUBFAMILY B19 (ABCB19) that mediates the polar transport of the phytohormone auxin together with PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins. Polar auxin transport establishes the auxin concentration gradient essential for plant development and tropisms. Deficiency of ABCB19 activity eventually caused enhanced gravitropic responses of the inflorescence stems and abnormally flexed inflorescence stems. These results suggest that ABCB19-mediated auxin transport plays a role not only in tropism regulation, but also in cytoplasmic streaming.},

abstract = {Auxin is an essential regulator for plant development. To elucidate the mechanisms by which auxin regulates plant development, we isolated an Arabidopsis mutant naked pins in yuc mutants 1 (npy1) that develops pin-like inflorescences and fails to initiate any flowers in yuc1 yuc4, a background that is defective in auxin biosynthesis. The phenotypes of npy1 yuc1 yuc4 triple mutants closely resemble those of Arabidopsis mutants pin-formed1 (pin1), pinoid (pid), and monopteros (mp), which are defective in either auxin transport or auxin signaling. NPY1 belongs to a large family of proteins and is homologous to NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3 (NPH3), a BTB/POZ protein that regulates phototropic responses along with the protein kinase PHOT1 (Phototropin 1). We demonstrate that NPY1 works with the protein kinase PID, which is homologous to PHOT1, to regulate auxin-mediated plant development. The npy1 pid double mutants fail to form any cotyledons, a phenotype that is also observed in yuc1 yuc4 pid triple mutants. Interestingly, both auxin-regulated organogenesis and phototropic responses require an auxin response factor (ARF). Disruption of ARF7/NPH4 leads to nonphototropic hypocotyls and arf5/mp forms pin-like inflorescences. Whereas the PHOT1/NPH3 pathway is regulated by light, our data suggest that the PID/NPY1 pathway may be regulated by auxin synthesized by the YUC flavin monooxygenases. Our findings put YUCs, PID, and NPY1 into a genetic framework for further dissecting the mechanisms of auxin action in plant development.},

abstract = {Tissue patterning in multicellular organisms is the output of precise spatio–temporal regulation of gene expression coupled with changes in hormone dynamics. In plants, the hormone auxin regulates growth and development at every stage of a plant's life cycle. Auxin signaling occurs through binding of the auxin molecule to a TIR1/AFB F-box ubiquitin ligase, allowing interaction with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins. These are subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded via the 26S proteasome, leading to derepression of auxin response factors (ARFs). How auxin is able to elicit such a diverse range of developmental responses through a single signaling module has not yet been resolved. Here we present an alternative auxin-sensing mechanism in which the ARF ARF3/ETTIN controls gene expression through interactions with process-specific transcription factors. This noncanonical hormonesensing mechanism exhibits strong preference for the naturally occurring auxin indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) and is important for coordinating growth and patterning in diverse developmental contexts such as gynoecium morphogenesis, lateral root emergence, ovule development, and primary branch formation. Disrupting this IAA-sensing ability induces morphological aberrations with consequences for plant fitness. Therefore, our findings introduce a novel transcription factor-based mechanism of hormone perception in plants.},

abstract = {Vascular plants evolved in the Middle to Late Silurian period, about 420 million years ago(1). The fossil record indicates that these primitive plants had branched stems with sporangia but no leaves. Leaf-like lateral outgrowths subsequently evolved on at least two independent occasions(2-4). In extant plants, these events are represented by microphyllous leaves in lycophytes (clubmosses, spikemosses and quillworts) and megaphyllous leaves in euphyllophytes ( ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms). Our current understanding of how leaves develop is restricted to processes that operate during megaphyll formation. Because microphylls and megaphylls evolved independently, different mechanisms might be required for leaf formation. Here we show that this is not so. Gene expression data from a microphyllous lycophyte, phylogenetic analyses, and a cross-species complementation experiment all show that a common developmental mechanism can underpin both microphyll and megaphyll formation. We propose that this mechanism might have operated originally in the context of primitive plant apices to facilitate bifurcation. Recruitment of this pathway to formleaves occurred independently and in parallel in different plant lineages.},

In some cases, pin1-1 forms a flower with abnormal structure (wide petals, no stamens, pistil-like structure with no ovules in the ovary) at the top of inflorescence axes. In other cases, no floral buds are formed on the axes. An independently isolated allelic mutant (pin1-2) shows similar phenotypes. These mutant phenotypes are exactly the same in wild-type plants cultured in the presence of chemical compounds known as auxin polar transport inhibitors: 9-hydroxyfluorene-9-carboxylic acid or N-(1-naphthyl)phthalamic acid. We tested the polar transport activity of indole-3-acetic acid and the endogenous amount of free indole-3-acetic acid in the tissue of inflorescence axes of the pin1 mutants and wild type. The polar transport activity in the pin 1-1 mutant and in the pin1-2 mutant was decreased to 14{\%} and 7{\%} of wild type, respectively. These observations strongly suggest that the normal level of polar transport activity in the inflorescence axes is required in early developmental stages of floral bud formation in Arabidopsis and that the primary function of the pin1 gene is auxin polar transport in the inflorescence axis.},

Here we use postembryonic development in Arabidopsis plants to investigate the genetic control of growth. We demonstrate that gene expression driving the production of the growth-stimulating hormone gibberellic acid and downstream growth factors is first induced within the radicle tip of the embryo. The center of cell expansion is, however, spatially displaced from the center of gene expression. Because the rapidly growing cells have very different geometry from that of those at the tip, we hypothesized that mechanical factors may contribute to this growth displacement. To this end we developed 3D finite-element method models of growing custom-designed digital embryos at cellular resolution. We used this framework to conceptualize how cell size, shape, and topology influence tissue growth and to explore the interplay of geometrical and genetic inputs into growth distribution. Our simulations showed that mechanical constraints are sufficient to explain the disconnect between the experimentally observed spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and early post-embryonic growth. The center of cell expansion is the position where genetic and mechanical facilitators of growth converge. We have thus uncovered a mechanism whereby 3D cellular geometry helps direct where genetically specified growth takes place.},

In the mid-80s, Renate pioneered studies on the ion-conducting properties of the recently discovered early and late endosomes and the mechanisms governing endosomal acidification. As described in this review, after uptake through one of many mechanistically distinct endocytic pathways, internalized proteins merge into a common early/sorting endosome. From there they again diverge along distinct sorting pathways, back to the cell surface, on to the trans-Golgi network or across polarized cells. Other transmembrane receptors are packaged into intraluminal vesicles of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies that eventually fuse with and deliver their content to lysosomes for degradation. Endosomal acidification, in part, determines sorting along this pathway. We describe other sorting machinery and mechanisms, as well as the rab proteins and phosphatidylinositol lipids that serve to dynamically define membrane compartments along the endocytic pathway.},

Actin-nucleating proteins participate in cell expansion and cell plate formation whereas the recycling of actin monomers is required to maintain actin dynamics and controlled growth.

abstract = {Plant cells divide using the phragmoplast, a microtubule-based structure that directs vesicles secretion to the nascent cell plate. The phragmoplast forms at the cell center and expands to reach a specified site at the cell periphery, tens or hundreds of microns distant. The mechanism responsible for guiding the phragmoplast remains largely unknown. Here, using both moss and tobacco, we show that myosin VIII associates with the ends of phragmoplast microtubules and together with actin plays a role in guiding phragmoplast expansion to the cortical division site. Our data lead to a model whereby myosin VIII links phragmoplast microtubules to the cortical division site via actin filaments. Myosin VIII's motor activity along actin provides a molecular mechanism for steering phragmoplast expansion.Plant cells are surrounded by a membrane, which controls what enters and leaves the cell, and a cell wall, which provides rigidity. When a plant cell is ready to divide, it needs to produce two new cell membranes, with a new cell wall sandwiched between them, to split the cell contents into two daughter cells.During the division process the cell builds a scaffold called the phragmoplast that guides the delivery of the materials that are needed to make the new cell wall and membranes. The phragmoplast—which is made of rod-like proteins called microtubules and actin filaments—starts at the centre of the cell and expands towards a pre-determined site on the existing cell wall. The question is: how does the phragmoplast target this site, which can be tens or hundreds of microns away?Wu and Bezanilla have now found that a protein called myosin VIII has a central role in guiding the growing phragmoplast to the cell wall. Myosin VIII is a motor protein that moves along actin filaments. Wu and Bezanilla propose that myosin VIII can guide the expansion of the phragmoplast by pulling microtubules along the actin filaments.The experiments were carried out on two distantly-related plant species, tobacco and a moss called Physcomitrella patens. Similar results were found in both species so it is possible that myosin VIII may play the same role in cell division in all plants.},

Because of the large number of myosin XI genes in angiosperms, it has been difficult to determine their precise role, particularly with respect to tip growth. The moss Physcomitrella patens provides an ideal system to study myosin XI function. P. patens has only two myosin XI genes, and these genes encode proteins that are 94{\%} identical to each other. To determine their role in tip growth, we used RNA interference to specifically silence each myosin XI gene using 59 untranslated region sequences. We discovered that the two myosin XI genes are functionally redundant, since silencing of either gene does not affect growth or polarity. However, simultaneous silencing of both myosin XIs results in severely stunted plants composed of small rounded cells. Although similar to the phenotype resulting from silencing of other actin-associated proteins, we show that this phenotype is not due to altered actin dynamics. Consistent with a role in tip growth, we show that a functional, full-length fusion of monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) to myosin XI accumulates at a subcortical, apical region of actively growing protonemal cells {\textcopyright} 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract = {Summary The colonization of the land by plants, sometime before 470 million years ago, was accompanied by the evolution tissue systems [1-3]. Specialized structures with diverse functions - from nutrient acquisition to reproduction - derived from single cells in the outermost layer (epidermis) were important sources of morphological innovation at this time [2, 4, 5]. In extant plants, these structures may be unicellular extensions, such as root hairs or rhizoids [6-9], or multicellular structures, such as asexual propagules or secretory hairs (papillae) [10-12]. Here, we show that a ROOTHAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE (RSL) class I basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor positively regulates the development of the unicellular and multicellular structures that develop from individual cells that expand out of the epidermal plane of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha; mutants that lack MpRSL1 function do not develop rhizoids, slime papillae, mucilage papillae, or gemmae. Furthermore, we discovered that RSL class I genes are also required for the development of multicellular axillary hairs on the gametophyte of the moss Physcomitrella patens. Because class I RSL proteins also control the development of rhizoids in mosses and root hairs in angiosperms [13, 14], these data demonstrate that the function of RSL class I genes was to control the development of structures derived from single epidermal cells in the common ancestor of the land plants. Class I RSL genes therefore controlled the generation of adaptive morphological diversity as plants colonized the land from the water.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that cell dispersal is a widespread phenomenon in the development of early vertebrate embryos. These cell movements coincide with major decisions for the spatial organization of the embryo, and they parallel genetic patterning events. For example, in the central nervous system, cell dispersal is first mainly anterior–posterior and subsequently dorsal–ventral. Thus, genes expressed in signaling centers of the embryo probably control cell movements, tightly linking cellular and genetic patterning. Cell dispersal might be important for the correct positioning of cells and tissues involved in intercellular signaling. The emergence of cell dispersal at the onset of vertebrate evolution indicates a shift from early, lineage-based cellular patterning in small embryos to late, movement-based cellular patterning of polyclones in large embryos. The conservation of the same basic body plan by invertebrate and vertebrate chordates suggests that evolution of the embryonic period preceding the phylotypic stage was by intercalary co-option of basic cell activities present in the ancestral metazoan cell.},

abstract = {The regular arrangement of leaves around a plant's stem, called phyllotaxis, has for centuries attracted the attention of philosophers, mathematicians and natural scientists; however, to date, studies of phyllotaxis have been largely theoretical. Leaves and flowers are formed from the shoot apical meristem, triggered by the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is transported through plant tissues by specific cellular influx and efflux carrier proteins. Here we show that proteins involved in auxin transport regulate phyllotaxis. Our data indicate that auxin is transported upwards into the meristem through the epidermis and the outermost meristem cell layer. Existing leaf primordia act as sinks, redistributing auxin and creating its heterogeneous distribution in the meristem. Auxin accumulation occurs only at certain minimal distances from existing primordia, defining the position of future primordia. This model for phyllotaxis accounts for its reiterative nature, as well as its regularity and stability.},

abstract = {The control of the cylindrical cell form in plants appears to reside in the orientation of the reinforcing cellulose microfibrils in the side walls. In elongating cells the fibrils are typically transverse. Control of new synthesis of oriented wall texture is shown to be in turn related to the orientation of cytoplasmic elements in the cell periphery. Three properties of these cytoplasmic elements have been deduced from polarization optical properties of treated and normal cell walls. These deduced properties- namely, possession of a long axis and the ability to build microfibrils perpendicular to it, a tendency to cross-bond to make a parallel array, and a sensitivity of this alignment to colchicine-are all well-known properties of mitotic spindle and phragmoplast fibers which form the cross-wall after mitosis. It is proposed that proteins of spindle fiber nature exist in cortical cytoplasm of plant cells and are active in the control of wall texture and cell form.},

abstract = {All cellular compartments are separated from the external environment by a membrane, which consists of a lipid bilayer. Subcellular structures, including clathrin-coated pits, caveolae, filopodia, lamellipodia, podosomes, and other intracellular membrane systems, are molded into their specific submicron-scale shapes through various mechanisms. Cells construct their micro-structures on plasma membrane and execute vital functions for life, such as cell migration, cell division, endocytosis, exocytosis, and cytoskeletal regulation. The plasma membrane, rich in anionic phospholipids, utilizes the electrostatic nature of the lipids, specifically the phosphoinositides, to form interactions with cytosolic proteins. These cytosolic proteins have three modes of interaction: 1) electrostatic interaction through unstructured polycationic regions, 2) through structured phosphoinositide-specific binding domains, and 3) through structured domains that bind the membrane without specificity for particular phospholipid. Among the structured domains, there are several that have membrane-deforming activity, which is essential for the formation of concave or convex membrane curvature. These domains include the amphipathic helix, which deforms the membrane by hemi-insertion of the helix with both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and/or the BAR domain superfamily, known to use their positively charged, curved structural surface to deform membranes. Below the membrane, actin filaments support the micro-structures through interactions with several BAR proteins as well as other scaffold proteins, resulting in outward and inward membrane micro-structure formation. Here, we describe the characteristics of phospholipids, and the mechanisms utilized by phosphoinositides to regulate cellular events. We then summarize the precise mechanisms underlying the construction of membrane micro-structures and their involvements in physiological and pathological processes.},

abstract = {Rho GTPases play crucial roles in cell polarity and pattern formation. ROPs, Rho of plant GTPases, are widely involved in cell wall patterning in plants, yet the molecular mechanism underlying their action remains unknown. Arabidopsis ROP11 is locally activated to form plasma membrane domains, which direct formation of cell wall pits in metaxylem vessel cells through interaction with cortical microtubules. Here, we show that the pattern formation of cell wall pits is governed by ROP activation via a reaction-diffusion mechanism. Genetic analysis and reconstructive assays revealed that ROPGEF4/7 and ROPGAP3/4, which encode ROP activators and inactivators, respectively, regulated the formation of ROP-activated domains; these in turn determined the pattern of cell wall pits. Mathematical modelling showed that ROP-activation cycle generated ROP domains by reaction-diffusion mechanism. The model predicted that a positive feedback and slow diffusion of ROP11-ROPGEF4 complex were required to generate ROP-activated domains. ROPGEF4 formed a dimer that interacted with activated ROP11 in vivo, which could provide positive feedback for ROP activation. ROPGEF4 was highly stable on the plasma membrane and inhibited ROP11 diffusion. Our study indicated that ROP-based reaction-diffusion system self-organizes ROP-activated domains, thereby determines the pit pattern of metaxylem vessels.},

This variability was strongly decreased in a mutant impaired in the microtubule-severing protein katanin. Major shape defects in the mutant could be related to a local decrease in growth heterogeneity. We show that katanin is required for the cell's competence to respond to the mechanical forces generated by growth. This provides the basis for a model in which microtubule dynamics allow the cell to respond efficiently to mechanical forces.

We characterized the role of auxin in regulating the function of PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 in the chloronema-to-caulonema transition during protonema development. Here, we showed that a gradient of cell identity developed along protonemal filaments; cells were chloronemal in proximal regions near the site of spore germination becoming progressively more caulonemal distally as filaments elongated. Auxin controlled this transition by positively regulating the expression of PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 genes. Auxin did not induce caulonemal development in Pprsl1 Pprsl2 double mutants that lack PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 gene activity while constitutive co-expression of PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 in the absence of auxin was sufficient to program constitutive caulonema development. Together, these data indicate that auxin positively regulates PpRSL1 and PpRSL2 whose expression is sufficient to promote caulonema differentiation in moss protonema.},

Here we compared the predictions of a mathematical model of epithelial growth with the morphological analysis of 3D epithelial structures. In both in vitro cyst models and in developing epithelial structures in vivo, epithelial growth could take place close to or far from mechanical equilibrium, and was determined by the hierarchy of time-scales of cell division, cell-cell rearrangements, and lumen dynamics. Equilibrium properties could be inferred by the analysis of cell-cell contact topologies, and the nonequilibrium phenotype was altered by inhibiting ROCK activity. The occurrence of an aberrant multilumen phenotype was linked to fast nonequilibrium growth, even when geometric control of cell division was correctly enforced. We predicted and verified experimentally that slowing down cell division partially rescued a multilumen phenotype induced by altered polarity. These results improve our understanding of the development of epithelial organs and, ultimately, of carcinogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cerruti et al.},

abstract = {Auxin-response factors (ARFs) bind with specificity to TGTCTC auxin-response elements (AuxREs), which are found in promoters of primary/early auxin-response genes. Nine different ARFs have been analyzed for their capacity to activate or repress transcription in transient expression assays employing auxin-responsive GUS reporter genes. One ARF appears to act as a repressor. Four ARFs function as activators and contain glutamine-rich activation domains. To achieve transcriptional activation on TGTCTC AuxREs in transient expression assays, ARFs require a conserved dimerization domain found in both ARF and Aux/IAA proteins, but they do not absolutely require their DNA-binding domains. Our results suggest that ARFs can activate or repress transcription by binding to AuxREs directly and that selected ARFs, when overexpressed, may potentiate activation further by associating with an endogenous transcription factor(s) (e.g., an ARF) that is bound to AuxREs. Transfection experiments suggest that TGTCTC AuxREs are occupied regardless of the auxin status in cells and that these occupied AuxREs are activated when exogenous auxin is applied to cells or when ARF activators are overexpressed. The results provide new insight into mechanisms involved with auxin regulation of primary/early-response genes.},

In all plants, subapical proliferation within the shoot tip displaces cells downward to extrude the cylindrical stem. Following the transition to flowering, many plants show extensive axial elongation associated with increased subapical proliferation and expansion. However, the cereal grasses also elongate their stems, called culms, due to activity within detached intercalary meristems which displaces cells upward, elevating the grain-bearing inflorescence. Variation in culm length within species is especially relevant to cereal crops, as demonstrated by the high-yielding semi-dwarfed cereals of the Green Revolution. Although previously understudied, recent renewed interest the regulation of subapical and intercalary growth suggests that control of cell division planes, boundary formation and temporal dynamics of differentiation, are likely critical mechanisms coordinating axial growth and development in plants.},

Our experiments reveal that both PIN1 localization and microtubule array orientation are likely to respond to a shared upstream regulator that appears to be biomechanical in nature.

abstract = {Proper orientation of the cell division axis is critical for asymmetric cell divisions that underpin cell differentiation. In animals, centrosomes are the dominant microtubule organizing centers (MTOC) and play a pivotal role in axis determination by orienting the mitotic spindle. In land plants that lack centrosomes, a critical role of a microtubular ring structure, the preprophase band (PPB), has been observed in this process; the PPB is required for orienting (before prophase) and guiding (in telophase) the mitotic apparatus. However, plants must possess additional mechanisms to control the division axis, as certain cell types or mutants do not form PPBs. Here, using live imaging of the gametophore of the mossPhyscomitrella patens, we identified acentrosomal MTOCs, which we termed "gametosomes," appearing de novo and transiently in the prophase cytoplasm independent of PPB formation. We show that gametosomes are dispensable for spindle formation but required for metaphase spindle orientation. In some cells, gametosomes appeared reminiscent of the bipolar MT "polar cap" structure that forms transiently around the prophase nucleus in angiosperms. Specific disruption of the polar caps in tobacco cells misoriented the metaphase spindles and frequently altered the final division plane, indicating that they are functionally analogous to the gametosomes. These results suggest a broad use of transient MTOC structures as the spindle orientation machinery in plants, compensating for the evolutionary loss of centrosomes, to secure the initial orientation of the spindle in a spatial window that allows subsequent fine-tuning of the division plane axis by the guidance machinery.},

abstract = {Directional control of tip-growing cells is essential for proper tissue organization and cell-to-cell communication in animals and plants 1,2. In the sexual reproduction of flowering plants, the tip growth of the male gametophyte, the pollen tube, is precisely guided by female cues to achieve fertilization 3. Several female-secreted peptides have recently been identified as species-specific attractants that directly control the direction of pollen tube growth 4-6. However, the method by which pollen tubes precisely and promptly respond to the guidance signal from their own species is unknown. Here we show that tip-localized pollen-specific receptor-like kinase 6 (PRK6) with an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain is an essential receptor for sensing of the LURE1 attractant peptide in Arabidopsis thaliana under semi-in-vivo conditions, and is important for ovule targeting in the pistil. PRK6 interacted with pollen-expressed ROPGEFs (Rho of plant guanine nucleotide-exchange factors), which are important for pollen tube growth through activation of the signalling switch Rho GTPase ROP1 (refs 7, 8). PRK6 conferred responsiveness to AtLURE1 in pollen tubes of the related species Capsella rubella. Furthermore, our genetic and physiological data suggest that PRK6 signalling through ROPGEFs and sensing of AtLURE1 are achieved in cooperation with the other PRK family receptors, PRK1, PRK3 and PRK8. Notably, the tip-focused PRK6 accumulated asymmetrically towards an external AtLURE1 source before reorientation of pollen tube tip growth. These results demonstrate that PRK6 acts as a key membrane receptor for external AtLURE1 attractants, and recruits the core tip-growth machinery, including ROP signalling proteins. This work provides insights into the orchestration of efficient pollen tube growth and species-specific pollen tube attraction by multiple receptors during male-female communication. In the final step of pollen tube guidance, two synergid cells on the side of the egg cell are essential for the attraction of the pollen tube to the ovule 9. We previously identified diffusible and species-specific attractants, defensin-like cysteine-rich LURE peptides, secreted from the synergid cell in the dicot plants Torenia fournieri and A. thaliana 4,6 .},

By measuring the distributions of reporters on/within the membrane of PVC/ MVB or tonoplast, we have identified dominant negative mutants of ESCRT-III subunits that affect membrane protein degradation from both secretory and endocytic pathways. In addition, induced expression of these mutants resulted in reduction in luminal vesicles of PVC/MVB, along with increased detection of membrane-attaching vesicles inside the PVC/MVB. Transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants with induced expression of ESCRT-III dominant negative mutants also displayed severe cotyledon developmental defects with reduced cell size, loss of the central vacuole, and abnormal chloroplast development in mesophyll cells, pointing out an essential role of the ESCRT-III complex in postembryonic development in plants. Finally, membrane dissociation of ESCRT-III components is important for their biological functions and is regulated by direct interaction among Vacuolar Protein Sorting-Associated Protein20-1 (VPS20.1), Sucrose Nonfermenting7-1, VPS2.1, and the adenosine triphosphatase VPS4/SUPPRESSOR OF K 1 TRANSPORT GROWTH DEFECT1. Endomembrane trafficking in plant cells is complicated such that secretory, endocytic, and recycling pathways are usually integrated with each other at the post-Golgi compartments, among which, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and prevacuolar compartment (PVC)/multivesicular body (MVB) are best studied (Tse et al.},

abstract = {Land plant bodies develop from meristems, groups of pluripotent stem cells, which may persist throughout the life of a plant or, alternatively, have a transitory existence. Early diverging land plants exhibit indeterminate (persistent) growth in their haploid gametophytic generation, whereas later diverging lineages exhibit indeterminate growth in their diploid sporophytic generation, raising the question of whether genetic machinery directing meristematic functions was co-opted between generations. Class III HD-Zip (C3HDZ) genes are required for the establishment and maintenance of shoot apical meristems in flowering plants. We demonstrate that in the moss Physcomitrella patens, C3HDZ genes are expressed in transitory meristems in both the gametophytic and sporophytic generations, but not in the persistent shoot meristem of the gametyphyte. Loss-of-function of P. patens C3HDZ was engineered using ectopic expression of miR166, an endogenous regulator of C3HDZ gene activity. Loss of C3HDZ gene function impaired the function of gametophytic transitory meristematic activity but did not compromise the functioning of the persistent shoot apical meristem during the gametophyte generation. These results argue against a wholesale co-option of meristematic gene regulatory networks from the gametophyte to the sporophyte during land plant evolution, instead suggesting that persistent meristems with a single apical cell in P. patens and persistent complex meristems in flowering plants are regulated by different genetic programs.},

abstract = {One of the most important events in the history of life on earth was the colonization of land by plants; this transition coincided with and was most likely enabled by the evolution of 3-dimensional (3D) growth. Today, the diverse morphologies exhibited across the terrestrial biosphere arise from the differential regulation of 3D growth processes during development. In many plants, 3D growth is initiated during the first few divisions of the zygote, and therefore, the genetic basis cannot be dissected because mutants do not survive. However, in mosses, which are representatives of the earliest land plants, 3D shoot growth is preceded by a 2D filamentous phase that can be maintained indefinitely. Here, we used the moss Physcomitrella patens to identify genetic regulators of the 2D to 3D transition. Mutant screens yielded individuals that could only grow in 2D, and through an innovative strategy that combined somatic hybridization with bulk segregant analysis and genome sequencing, the causative mutation was identified in one of them. The NO GAMETOPHORES 1 (NOG1) gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-associated protein, is present only in land plant genomes. In mutants that lack PpNOG1 function, transcripts encoding 3D-promoting PpAPB transcription factors [1] are significantly reduced, and apical initial cells specified for 3D growth are not formed. PpNOG1 acts at the earliest identified stage of the 2D to 3D transition, possibly through degradation of proteins that suppress 3D growth. The acquisition of NOG1 function in land plants could thus have enabled the evolution and development of 3D morphology.},

abstract = {Coordinating growth and communication between adjacent cells is a critical yet poorly understood aspect of tissue development and organ morphogenesis. We report a Rho GTPase signaling network underlying the jigsaw puzzle appearance of Arabidopsis leaf pavement cells, in which localized outgrowth in one cell is coordinated with localized inhibition of outgrowth of the adjacent cell to form interdigitating lobes and indentations. Locally activated ROP2, a Rho-related GTPase from plants, activates RIC4 to promote the assembly of cortical actin microfilaments required for localized outgrowth. Meanwhile, ROP2 inactivates another target RIC1, whose activity promotes well-ordered cortical microtubules. RIC1-dependent microtubule organization not only locally inhibits outgrowth but in turn suppresses ROP2 activation in the indentation zones. Thus, outgrowth-promoting ROP2 and outgrowth-inhibiting RIC1 pathways antagonize each other. We propose that the counteractivity of these two pathways demarcates outgrowing and indenting cortical domains, coordinating a process that gives rise to interdigitations between adjacent pavement cells.},

abstract = {Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally.},

Our experiments also revealed that the plasma membrane phosphatidylserine content varies during plant root development and that the level of phosphatidylserine modulates the quantity of ROP6 nanoclusters induced by auxin and hence downstream signaling, including regulation of endocytosis and gravitropism.

Using the PpSHI1 and PpSHI2 reporter and knockout lines, the auxin reporters GmGH3(pro):GUS and PpPINA(pro):GFP-GUS, and the auxin-conjugating transgene PpSHI2(pro):IAAL, we could show that the PpSHI genes, and by inference also auxin, play important roles for reproductive organ development in moss. The PpSHI genes are required for the apical opening of the reproductive organs, the final differentiation of the egg cell, and the progression of canal cells into a cell death program. The apical cells of the archegonium, the canal cells, and the egg cell are also sites of auxin responsiveness and are affected by reduced levels of active auxin, suggesting that auxin mediates PpSHI function in the reproductive organs.},

Microtubules (MTs) play a crucial role in the anisotropic deposition of cell wall material, thereby affecting the direction of growth. A wide range of tip-growing cells display highly polarized cell growth, and MTs have been implicated in regulating directionality and expansion. However, the molecular machinery underlying MT dynamics in tip-growing plant cells remains unclear. Here, we show that highly dynamic MT bundles form cyclically in the polarized expansion zone of the moss Physcomitrella patens caulonemal cells through the coalescence of growing MT plus ends. Furthermore, the plant-specific kinesins (KINID1) that are is essential for the proper MT organization at cytokinesis also regulate the turnover of the tip MT bundles as well as the directionality and rate of cell growth. The plus ends of MTs grow toward the expansion zone, and KINID1 is necessary for the stability of a single coherent focus of MTs in the center of the zone, whose formation coincides with the accumulation of KINID1. We propose that KINID-dependent MT bundling is essential for the correct directionality of growth as well as for promoting growth per se. Our findings indicate that two localized cell wall deposition processes, tip growth and cytokinesis, previously believed to be functionally and evolutionarily distinct, share common and plant-specific MT regulatory components.},

A structural analysis reveals the mode of the interaction as an intermolecular $\beta$-sheet in addition to the structure of the BRX domain.

abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is required for cell expansion and is implicated in cellular responses to the plant growth hormone auxin. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that coordinate auxin signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell expansion are poorly understood. Previous studies have examined actin cytoskeleton responses to long-term auxin treatment, but plants respond to auxin over short timeframes, and growth changes within minutes of exposure to the hormone. To correlate actin arrays with degree of cell expansion, we used quantitative imaging tools to establish a baseline of actin organization, as well as of individual filament behaviors in root epidermal cells under control conditions and after treatment with a known inhibitor of root growth, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We found that cell length was highly predictive of actin array in control roots, and that short-term IAA treatment stimulated denser, more longitudinal, and more parallel arrays by inducing filament unbundling within minutes. By demonstrating that actin filaments were more “organized” after a treatment that stopped elongation, we show there is no direct relationship between actin organization and cell expansion and refute the hypothesis that “more organized” actin universally correlates with more rapidly growing root cells. The plasma membrane-bound auxin transporter AUXIN RESISTANT 1 (AUX1) has previously been shown necessary for archetypal short-term root growth inhibition in the presence of IAA. Although AUX1 was not previously suspected of being upstream of cytoskeletal responses to IAA, we used aux1 mutants to demonstrate that AUX1 is necessary for the full complement of actin rearrangements in response to auxin, and that cytoplasmic auxin in the form of NAA is sufficient to stimulate a partial actin response. Together, these results are the first to quantitate actin cytoskeleton response to short-term auxin treatments and demonstrate that AUX1 is necessary for short-term actin remodeling.

abstract = {It is well known that the parallel order of microtubules in the plant cell cortex defines the direction of cell expansion, yet it remains unclear how microtubule orientation is controlled, especially on a cell-wide basis. Here we show through 4D imaging and computational modelling that plant cell polyhedral geometry provides spatial input that determines array orientation and heterogeneity. Microtubules depolymerize when encountering sharp cell edges head-on, whereas those oriented parallel to those sharp edges remain. Edge-induced microtubule depolymerization, however, is overcome by the microtubule-associated protein CLASP, which accumulates at specific cell edges, enables microtubule growth around sharp edges and promotes formation of microtubule bundles that span adjacent cell faces. By computationally modelling dynamic 'microtubules on a cube' with edges differentially permissive to microtubule passage, we show that the CLASP-edge complex is a 'tuneable' microtubule organizer, with the inherent flexibility to generate the numerous cortical array patterns observed in nature. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Cell polarization is intimately linked to plant development, growth, and responses to the environment. Major advances have been made in our understanding of the signaling pathways and networks that regulate cell polarity in plants owing to recent studies on several model systems, e.g., tip growth in pollen tubes, cell morphogenesis in the leaf epidermis, and polar localization of PINs. From these studies we have learned that plant cells use conserved mechanisms such as Rho family GTPases to integrate both plant-specific and conserved polarity cues and to coordinate the cytoskeketon dynamics/reorganization and vesic-ular trafficking required for polarity establishment and maintenance. This review focuses upon signaling mechanisms for cell polarity formation in Arabidopsis, with an emphasis on Rho GTPase signaling in polarized cell growth and how these mechanisms compare with those for cell polarity signaling in yeast and animal systems.},

abstract = {Little is known about the dynamics and molecular components of plant prevacuolar compartments (PVCs). We have demonstrated recently that vacuolar sorting receptor (VSR) proteins are concentrated on PVCs. In this study, we generated transgenic Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) BY-2 cell lines expressing two yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-fusion reporters that mark PVC and Golgi organelles. Both transgenic cell lines exhibited typical punctate YFP signals corresponding to distinct PVC and Golgi organelles because the PVC reporter colocalized with VSR proteins, whereas the Golgi marker colocalized with mannosidase I in confocal immunofluorescence. Brefeldin A induced the YFP-labeled Golgi stacks but not the YFP-marked PVCs to form typical enlarged structures. By contrast, wortmannin caused YFP-labeled PVCs but not YFP-labeled Golgi stacks to vacuolate. VSR antibodies labeled multivesicular bodies (MVBs) on thin sections prepared from high-pressure frozen/freeze substituted samples, and the enlarged PVCs also were indentified as MVBs. MVBs were further purified from BY-2 cells and found to contain VSR proteins via immunogold negative staining. Similar to YFP-labeled Golgi stacks, YFP-labeled PVCs are mobile organelles in BY-2 cells. Thus, we have unequivocally identified MVBs as PVCs in N. tabacum BY-2 cells. Uptake studies with the styryl dye FM4-64 strongly indicate that PVCs also lie on the endocytic pathway of BY-2 cells.},

Notwithstanding the existence of these stable cell states, in land plants, stem cells are formed from differentiated cells during post-embryonic development and regeneration4–6, indicating that land plants have an intrinsic ability to regulate epigenetic memory to initiate a new gene regulatory network. However, it is less well understood how epigenetic modifications are locally regulated to influence the specific genes necessary for cellular changes without affecting other genes in a genome. In this study, we found that ectopic induction of the AP2/ERF transcription factor STEMIN1 in leaf cells of the moss Physcomitrella patens decreases a repressive chromatin mark, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), on its direct target genes before cell division, resulting in the conversion of leaf cells to chloronema apical stem cells. STEMIN1 and its homologues positively regulate the formation of secondary chloronema apical stem cells from chloronema cells during development. Our results suggest that STEMIN1 functions within an intrinsic mechanism underlying local H3K27me3 reprogramming to initiate stem cell formation.},

abstract = {Leaves are the main photosynthetic organs of vascular plants and show considerable diversity in their geometries, ranging from simple spoon-like forms to complex shapes with individual leaflets, as in compound leaves. Leaf vascular tissues, which act as conduits of both nutrients and signaling information, are organized in networks of different architectures that usually mirror the surrounding leaf shape. Understanding the processes that endow leaves and vein networks with ordered and closely aligned shapes has captured the attention of biologists and mathematicians since antiquity. Recent work has suggested that the growth regulator auxin has a key role in both initiation and elaboration of final morphology of both leaves and vascular networks. A key feature of auxin action is the existence of feedback loops through which auxin regulates its own transport. These feedbacks may facilitate the iterative generation of basic modules that underlies morphogenesis of both leaves and vasculature.},

abstract = {RAB GTPases are key regulators of membrane traffic. Among them, RAB11, a widely conserved sub-group, has evolved in a unique way in plants; plant RAB11 members show notable diversity, whereas yeast and animals have only a few RAB11 members. Fifty-seven RAB GTPases are encoded in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, 26 of which are classified in the RAB11 group (further divided into RABA1-RABA6 sub-groups). Although several plant RAB11 members have been shown to play pivotal roles in plant-unique developmental processes, including cytokinesis and tip growth, molecular and physiological functions of the majority of RAB11 members remain unknown. To reveal precise functions of plant RAB11, we investigated the subcellular localization and dynamics of the largest sub-group of Arabidopsis RAB11, RABA1, which has nine members. RABA1 members reside on mobile punctate structures adjacent to the trans-Golgi network and co-localized with VAMP721/722, R-SNARE proteins that operate in the secretory pathway. In addition, the constitutiveactive mutant of RABA1b, RABA1bQ72L, was present on the plasma membrane. The RABA1b-containing membrane structures showed actin-dependent dynamic motion. Vesicles labeled by GFP-RABA1b moved dynamically, forming queues along actin filaments. Interestingly, Arabidopsis plants whose four major RABA1 members were knocked out, and those expressing the dominant-negative mutant of RABA1B, exhibited hypersensitivity to salinity stress. Altogether, these results indicate that RABA1 members mediate transport between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane, and are required for salinity stress tolerance. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

The results of feeding experiments suggested that both the early and late C6-oxidation pathways occur during tracheary element differentiation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that five BRs, castasterone, typhasterol, 6-deoxocastasterone, 6-deoxotyphasterol, and 6-deoxoteasterone, actually existed in cultured zinnia cells and culture medium. Quantification of endogenous BRs in each stage of tracheary element differentiation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry exhibited that they increased dramatically prior to the morphogenesis, which was consistent with the idea that BRs are necessary for the initiation of the final stage of tracheary element differentiation. Moreover, the proportion of each BR in culture medium was quite different from that in cells, suggesting that specific BRs are selectively secreted into medium and may function outside the cells.},

This is largely dependent on the ability of plants to form new organs, such as lateral roots, leaves, and flowers during postembryonic development. Organ primordia develop from founder cell populations into organs by coordinated cell division and differentiation. Here, we show that organ formation in Arabidopsis involves dynamic gradients of the signaling molecule auxin with maxima at the primordia tips. These gradients are mediated by cellular efflux requiring asymmetrically localized PIN proteins, which represent a functionally redundant network for auxin distribution in both aerial and underground organs. PIN1 polar localization undergoes a dynamic rearrangement, which correlates with establishment of auxin gradients and primordium development. Our results suggest that PIN-dependent, local auxin gradients represent a common module for formation of all plant organs, regardless of their mature morphology or developmental origin.},

Selective uptake in multicellular organisms critically requires epithelia with extracellular diffusion barriers. In plants, such a barrier is provided by the endodermis and its Casparian strips - cell wall impregnations analogous to animal tight and adherens junctions. Interestingly, the endodermis undergoes secondary differentiation, becoming coated with hydrophobic suberin, presumably switching from an actively absorbing to a protective epithelium. Here, we show that suberization responds to a wide range of nutrient stresses, mediated by the stress hormones abscisic acid and ethylene. We reveal a striking ability of the root to not only regulate synthesis of suberin, but also selectively degrade it in response to ethylene. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in suberization constitute physiologically relevant, adaptive responses, pointing to a pivotal role of the endodermal membrane in nutrient homeostasis.},

Pollen tube biology is complex, presenting parallels with axon guidance and moving cell systems in animals. Pollen tube cells elongate on an active extra-cellular matrix in the style, ultimately guided by stylar and embryo sac signals. A well-documented recognition system occurs between pollen grains and the stigma in sporophytic self-incompatibility, where both receptor kinases in the stigma and their peptide ligands from pollen are now known. Complex mechanisms act to precisely target the sperm cells into the embryo sac. These events initiate double fertilization in which the two sperm cells from one pollen tube fuse to produce distinctly different products: one with the egg to produce the zygote and embryo and the other with the central cell to produce the endosperm.},

Here, we used chemical and genetic tools on Brassica napus microspore-derived embryos and Arabidopsis thaliana zygotic embryos, and demonstrate that AUX1, LAX1 and LAX2 are required for both shoot and root pole formation, in concert with PIN efflux carriers. Furthermore, we uncovered a positive-feedback loop between MONOPTEROS (ARF5)-dependent auxin signalling and auxin transport. This MONOPTEROS-dependent transcriptional regulation of auxin influx (AUX1, LAX1 and LAX2) and auxin efflux (PIN1 and PIN4) carriers by MONOPTEROS helps to maintain proper auxin transport to the root tip.

It has been assumed to operate in an evolutionary conserved manner as in yeast and animals. Here we report characterisation of ultrastructure, dynamics and mechanisms of plant CME as allowed by our advancement in electron microscopy and quantitative live imaging techniques. Arabidopsis CME follows the constant curvature model and the bona fide CME population generates vesicles of a predominantly hexagonal type; larger and with faster kinetics than in other models. Contrary to the existing paradigm, actin is dispensable for CME events at the surface but plays a unique role in collecting endocytic vesicles, sorting of internalised cargos and directional endosome movement that itself actively promote CME events. Internalized vesicles display a strongly delayed and sequential uncoating. These unique features highlight the independent evolution of the plant CME mechanism during the autonomous rise of multicellularity in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Directional intercellular transport of the phytohormone auxin mediated by PIN FORMED (PIN) efflux carriers plays essential roles in both coordinating patterning processes and integrating multiple external cues by rapidly redirecting auxin fluxes. Multilevel regulations of PIN activity under internal and external cues are complicated; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that 3'-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinase1 (PDK1), which is conserved in plants and mammals, functions as a molecular hub integrating the upstream lipid signalling and the downstream substrate activity through phosphorylation. Genetic analysis uncovers that loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant pdk1.1 pdk1.2 exhibits a plethora of abnormalities in organogenesis and growth, due to the defective PIN-dependent auxin transport. Further cellular and biochemical analyses reveal that PDK1 phosphorylates D6 Protein Kinase to facilitate its activity towards PIN proteins. Our studies establish a lipid-dependent phosphorylation cascade connecting membrane composition-based cellular signalling with plant growth and patterning by regulating morphogenetic auxin fluxes.},

abstract = {Although the vertebrate limb bud has been studied for decades as a model system for spatial pattern formation and cell specification, the cellular basis of its distally oriented elongation has been a relatively neglected topic by comparison. The conventional view is that a gradient of isotropic proliferation exists along the limb, with high proliferation rates at the distal tip and lower rates towards the body, and that this gradient is the driving force behind outgrowth. Here we test this hypothesis by combining quantitative empirical data sets with computer modelling to assess the potential role of spatially controlled proliferation rates in the process of directional limb bud outgrowth. In particular, we generate two new empirical data sets for the mouse hind limb-a numerical description of shape change and a quantitative 3D map of cell cycle times-and combine these with a new 3D finite element model of tissue growth. By developing a parameter optimization approach (which explores spatial patterns of tissue growth) our computer simulations reveal that the observed distribution of proliferation rates plays no significant role in controlling the distally extending limb shape, and suggests that directional cell activities are likely to be the driving force behind limb bud outgrowth. This theoretical prediction prompted us to search for evidence of directional cell orientations in the limb bud mesenchyme, and we thus discovered a striking highly branched and extended cell shape composed of dynamically extending and retracting filopodia, a distally oriented bias in Golgi position, and also a bias in the orientation of cell division. We therefore provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that limb bud elongation is achieved by directional cell activities, rather than a PD gradient of proliferation rates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Boehm et al.},

abstract = {Receptors for acid hydrolases destined for the lytic compartment in yeast and mammalian cells are retrieved from intermediate, endosomal organelles with the help of a pentameric protein complex called the retromer. We cloned the Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of the three yeast proteins (Vps35, Vps29, and Vps26) constituting the larger subunit of retromer and prepared antisera against them. With these antibodies, we demonstrated the presence of a retromer-like protein complex in salt extracts prepared from Arabidopsis microsomes. This complex is associated with membranes that coequilibrate with prevacuolar compartment markers and with high-density sedimenting membranes. Immunogold negative staining identified these membranes as 90-nm-diameter coated microvesicles. Confocal laser scanning immunofluores-cence studies performed on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells revealed high degrees of colabeling between all three retromer antisera and the prevacuolar compartment (PVC) markers PEP12 and vacuolar sorting receptor VSR At-1. The presence of plant retromer at the surface of multivesicular bodies was also demonstrated by immunogold labeling of sections obtained from high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted specimens. Treatment of BY-2 cells with wortmannin led to swelling of the PVC and a separation of the VPS35 and VSR signals. Preliminary data suggesting that retromer interacts with the cytosolic domain of a VSR were obtained by immunoprecipitation experiments performed on detergent-solubilized microsomes with Vps35 antibodies.},

It has recently been demonstrated that wortmannin at 16.5 mM or 33 mM caused the prevacuolar compartments (PVCs), identified as multivesicular bodies (MVBs) by their enrichment in vacuolar sorting receptor (VSRs) proteins and the BP-80 reporter, to form small vacuoles rapidly. However, the source(s) of the membrane needed for the rapid enlargement of PVCs/MVBs has been unclear. Using both confocal immunofluorescence and immunogold EM with high pressure freeze substitution of plant samples, it has been demonstrated here that wortmannin induces homotypic fusions of PVCs/MVBs thus providing an explanation for the demand for extra membrane. In addition, possible wortmannin-induced fusions between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and PVC, as well as between the small internal vesicles and PVC membrane, were also observed and they may also contribute to the membranes needed for PVC enlargement. In contrast to mammalian cells and yeast, wortmannin-induced fusion of PVCs appears to be unique to plants.},

abstract = {The primary inflorescence stem of Arabidopsis thaliana is rich in lignified cell walls, in both vascular bundles and interfascicular fibres. Previous gene expression studies demonstrated a correlation between expression of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes and a subset of genes encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, especially in the ABCB/multi-drug resistance/P-glycoprotein (ABCB/MDR/PGP) and ABCG/pleiotropic drug resistance (ABCG/PDR) subfamilies. The objective of this study was to characterize these ABC transporters in terms of their gene expression and their function in development of lignified cells. Based on in silico analyses, four ABC transporters were selected for detailed investigation: ABCB11/MDR8, ABCB14/MDR12, ABCB15/MDR13, and ABCG33/PDR5. Promoter::glucuronidase reporter assays for each gene indicated that promoters of ABCB11, ABCB14, ABCB15, and ABCG33 transporters are active in the vascular tissues of primary stem, and in some cases in interfascicular tissues as well. Homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant lines showed no apparent irregular xylem phenotype or alterations in interfascicular fibre lignification or morphology in comparison with wild type. However, in abcb14-1 mutants, stem vascular morphology was slightly disorganized, with decreased phloem area in the vascular bundle and decreased xylem vessel lumen diameter. In addition, abcb14-1 mutants showed both decreased polar auxin transport through whole stems and altered auxin distribution in the procambium. It is proposed that both ABCB14 and ABCB15 promote auxin transport since inflorescence stems in both mutants showed a reduction in polar auxin transport, which was not observed for any of the ABCG subfamily mutants tested. In the case of ABCB14, the reduction in auxin transport is correlated with a mild disruption of vascular development in the inflorescence stem.},

The nature of morphological and molecular innovation driving land plant evolution has been an enigma for over 200 years. Recent phylogenetic and palaeobotanical advances jointly demonstrate that land plants evolved from freshwater algae and pinpoint key morphological innovations in plant evolution. In the haploid gametophyte phase of the plant life cycle, these include the innovation of mulitcellular forms with apical growth and multiple growth axes. In the diploid phase of the life cycle, multicellular axial sporophytes were an early innovation priming subsequent diversification of indeterminate branched forms with leaves and roots. Reverse and forward genetic approaches in newly emerging model systems are starting to identify the genetic basis of such innovations. The data place plant evo-devo research at the cusp of discovering the developmental and genetic changes driving the radiation of land plant body plans.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evo-devo in the genomics era, and the origins of morphological diversity'.},

Here, we report the isolation of two blue light photoreceptor genes, designated cryptochrome genes 4 and 5 (CRY4 and CRY5), from the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris. Because previously we identified three cryptochrome genes, this fern cryptochrome gene family of five members is the largest identified to date in plants. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five genes show remarkable similarities with pre-viously identified cryptochromes as well as class I photolyases. Like the other plant cryptochromes, none of the crypto-chromes of this fern possesses photolyase activity. RNA gel blot analysis and competitive polymerase chain reaction analysis indicate that the expression of the newly identified CRY4 and CRY5 genes is regulated by light and is under phytochrome control. The intracellular distribution of reporter ␤ -glucuronidase (GUS)–CRY fusion proteins indicates that GUS–CRY3 and GUS–CRY4 localize in fern gametophyte nuclei. The nuclear localization of GUS–CRY3 is regulated in a light-dependent manner. Together with our physiological knowledge, these results suggest that CRY3, CRY4, or both might be the photoreceptor that mediates inhibition of spore germination by blue light.},

More than a dozen regulatory genes have now been identified through isolation of ovule mutants. Characterization of these mutants shows that some aspects of ovule development follow independent pathways, while other processes are interdependent. Some of these mutants have ovules resembling those of puta-tive ancestors of angiosperms and may help in understanding plant evolution. Clones of several of the regulatory genes have been used to determine expression patterns and putative biochemical functions of the gene products.

abstract = {The process of oriented divisions of polarised cells is a recurrent mechanism of cell fate diversification in development. It is commonly assumed that a specialised mechanism of spindle alignment into the axis of polarity is a prerequisite for such systems to generate cell fate diversity. Oriented divisions also take place in the frog blastula, where orientation of the spindle into the apicobasal axis of polarised blastomeres generates inner and outer cells with different fates. Here, we show that, in this system, the spindle orients according to the shape of the cells, a mechanism often thought to be a default. We show that in the embryo, fate-differentiative, perpendicular divisions correlate with a perpendicular long axis and a small apical surface, but the long axis rather then the size of the apical domain defines the division orientation. Mitotic spindles in rounded, yet polarised, isolated Xenopus blastula cells orient randomly, but align into an experimentally introduced long axis when cells are deformed early in the cell cycle. Unlike other systems of oriented divisions, the spindle aligns at prophase, rotation behaviour is rare and restricted to small angle adjustments. Disruption of astral microtubules leads to misalignment of the spindle. These results show that a mechanism of spindle orientation that depends on cell shape rather than cortical polarity can nevertheless generate cell fate diversity from a population of polarised cells.},

abstract = {Spatial control of cell-wall deposition is essential for determining plant cell shape [1]. Rho-type GTPases, together with the cortical cytoskeleton, play central roles in regulating cell-wall patterning [2]. In metaxylem vessel cells, which are the major components of xylem tissues, active ROP11 Rho GTPases form oval plasma membrane domains that locally disrupt cortical microtubules, thereby directing the formation of oval pits in secondary cell walls [3–5]. However, the regulatory mechanism that determines the planar shape of active Rho of Plants (ROP) domains is still unknown. Here we show that IQD13 associates with cortical microtubules and the plasma membrane to laterally restrict the localization of ROP GTPase domains, thereby directing the formation of oval secondary cell-wall pits. Loss and overexpression of IQD13 led to the formation of abnormally round and narrow secondary cell-wall pits, respectively. Ectopically expressed IQD13 increased the presence of parallel cortical microtubules by promoting microtubule rescue. A reconstructive approach revealed that IQD13 confines the area of active ROP domains within the lattice of the cortical microtubules, causing narrow ROP domains to form. This activity required the interaction of IQD13 with the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that IQD13 positively regulates microtubule dynamics as well as their linkage to the plasma membrane, which synergistically confines the area of active ROP domains, leading to the formation of oval secondary cell-wall pits. This finding sheds light on the role of microtubule-plasma membrane linkage as a lateral fence that determines the planar shape of Rho GTPase domains.},

abstract = {Land plants evolved a long-distance transport system of water and nutrients composed of the xylem and phloem, both of which are generated from the procambium- and cambium-comprising vascular stem cells. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of cell communication governing xylem-phloem patterning. Here, we show that a dodecapeptide (HEVHypSGHypNPISN; Hyp, 4-hydroxyproline), TDIF (tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factor), is secreted from the phloem and suppresses the differentiation of vascular stem cells into xylem cells through a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK). TDIF binds in vitro specifically to the LRR-RLK, designated TDR (putative TDIF receptor), whose expression is restricted to procambial cells. However, the combined analysis of TDIF with a specific antibody and the expression profiles of the promoters of two genes encoding TDIF revealed that TDIF is synthesized mainly in, and secreted from, the phloem and its neighboring cells. The observation that TDIF is capable of promoting proliferation of procambial cells while suppressing xylem differentiation suggests that this small peptide functions as a phloem-derived, non-cellautonomous signal that controls stem cell fate in the procambium. Our results indicate that we have discovered a cell communication system governing phloem-xylem cross-talk. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

To understand the collective cell behaviours underlying tissue morphogenesis, we have continuously quantified cell intercalation and cell shape change during GBE. We show that the fast, early phase of GBE depends on cell shape change in addition to cell intercalation. In antero-posterior patterning mutants such as those for the gap gene Kr{\"{u}}ppel, defective polarized cell intercalation is compensated for by an increase in antero-posterior cell elongation, such that the initial rate of extension remains the same. Spatio-temporal patterns of cell behaviours indicate that an antero-posterior tensile force deforms the germ band, causing the cells to change shape passively. The rate of antero-posterior cell elongation is reduced in twist mutant embryos, which lack mesoderm. We propose that cell shape change contributing to germ-band extension is a passive response to mechanical forces caused by the invaginating mesoderm.},

Casparian strips are precisely localized and aligned ring-like cell wall modifications in the root of all higher plants. They set up an extracellular diffusion barrier analogous to animal tight junctions, and are crucial for maintaining the homeostatic capacity of plant roots. Casparian strips become localized because of the formation of a highly stable plasma membrane domain, consisting of a family of small transmembrane proteins called Casparian strip membrane domain proteins (CASPs). Here we report a large-scale forward genetic screen directly visualizing endodermal barrier function, which allowed us to identify factors required for the formation and integrity of Casparian strips. We present the identification and characterization of one of the mutants, schengen1 (sgn 1), a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase that we show localizes in a strictly polar fashion to the outer plasma membrane of endodermal cells and is required for the positioning and correct formation of the centrally located CASP domain.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic development and stem cell control depend on the integration of cell positional sensing with cell cycle con-trol and cell wall positioning, yet few factors that directly link these events are known. The DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) gene encoding the unique plant calpain protein is fundamental for development and growth, being essential to confer and maintain epidermal cell identity that allows de-velopment beyond the globular embryo stage. We show that DEK1 expression is highest in the actively dividing cells of seeds, meristems and vasculature. We further show that eliminating Arabidopsis DEK1 function leads to changes in developmental cues from the first zygotic division onward, altered microtubule patterns and misshapen cells, resulting in early embryo abortion. Expression of the embryonic marker genes WOX2, ATML1, PIN4, WUS and STM, related to axis organization, cell identity and meristem functions, is also altered in dek1 embryos. By monitoring cell layer-specific DEK1 down-regulation, we show that L1-and 35S-induced down-regulation mainly affects stem cell functions, causing severe shoot apical meristem phenotypes. These re-sults are consistent with a requirement for DEK1 to direct layer-specific cellular activities and set downstream devel-opmental cues. Our data suggest that DEK1 may anchor cell wall positions and control cell division and differentiation, thereby balancing the plant's requirement to maintain toti-potent stem cell reservoirs while simultaneously directing growth and organ formation. A role for DEK1 in regulating microtubule-orchestrated cell wall orientation during cell division can explain its effects on embryonic development, and suggests a more general function for calpains in micro-tubule organization in eukaryotic cells.},

Their presence generates a paracellular barrier, analogous to animal tight junctions, that is thought to be crucial for selective nutrient uptake, exclusion of pathogens, and many other processes. Despite their importance, the chemical nature of Casparian strips has remained a matter of debate, confounding further molecular analysis. Suberin, lignin, lignin-like polymers, or both, have been claimed to make up Casparian strips. Here we show that, in Arabidopsis, suberin is produced much too late to take part in Casparian strip formation. In addition, we have generated plants devoid of any detectable suberin, which still establish functional Casparian strips. In contrast, manipulating lignin biosynthesis abrogates Casparian strip formation. Finally, monolignol feeding and lignin-specific chemical analysis indicates the presence of archetypal lignin in Casparian strips. Our findings establish the chemical nature of the primary root-diffusion barrier in Arabidopsis and enable a mechanistic dissection of the formation of Casparian strips, which are an independent way of generating tight junctions in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Proper orientation of the cell division axis is critical for asymmetric cell divisions that underpin cell differentiation. In animals, centrosomes are the dominant microtubule organizing centers (MTOC) and play a pivotal role in axis determination by orienting the mitotic spindle. In land plants that lack centrosomes, a critical role of a microtubular ring structure, the preprophase band (PPB), has been observed in this process; the PPB is required for orienting (before prophase) and guiding (in telophase) the mitotic apparatus. However, plants must possess additional mechanisms to control the division axis, as certain cell types or mutants do not form PPBs. Here, using live imaging of the gametophore of the moss Physcomitrella patens, we identified acentrosomal MTOCs, which we termed " gameto-somes, " appearing de novo and transiently in the prophase cytoplasm independent of PPB formation. We show that gametosomes are dis-pensable for spindle formation but required for metaphase spindle orientation. In some cells, gametosomes appeared reminiscent of the bipolar MT " polar cap " structure that forms transiently around the prophase nucleus in angiosperms. Specific disruption of the polar caps in tobacco cells misoriented the metaphase spindles and frequently altered the final division plane, indicating that they are functionally analogous to the gametosomes. These results suggest a broad use of transient MTOC structures as the spindle orientation machinery in plants, compensating for the evolutionary loss of centrosomes, to secure the initial orientation of the spindle in a spatial window that allows subsequent fine-tuning of the division plane axis by the guidance machinery. asymmetric cell division | spindle orientation | MTOC | Physcomitrella patens | $\gamma$-tubulin H ow do plants set their spindle division axis without centro-somes? In many angiosperm cell types, the cortical micro-tubules (MTs) are reorganized in G2 phase into a MT-based ring structure, the preprophase band (PPB), which encircles the nu-cleus at the cell cortex and represents a unique and key structure for oriented divisions in plants (1, 2). The PPB gradually de-generates during prophase. However, it defines the future di-vision zone by recruiting a specific set of proteins to the cortex (3–8). During telophase, the phragmoplast, the postanaphase mitotic apparatus that recruits membrane and cell plate material for cytokinesis, centrifugally expands toward the cell cortex and strikingly precisely reaches the zone that the PPB formerly oc-cupied. In addition to this " phragmoplast guidance " function, the PPB also sets initial spindle orientation. During degeneration of the PPB, nuclear envelope (NE)-associated MT structures, called polar caps, are formed on the opposite sides of the nucleus, per-pendicular to the plane of the PPB (this structure is also called prospindle or prophase spindle) (9–12). Arabidopsis cell lines that do not assemble PPBs fail to establish these caps, indicating a critical role of the PPB in initial spindle orientation (9). However, whether initial spindle orientation by the PPB is critical for division plane determination is not clear, as the guidance mechanism could be strong enough to correct an initially misoriented mitotic appa-ratus (13). Plants also must have developed a PPB-independent mechanism for division plane determination, as PPBs are not observed in certain plant cell types, such as gametophytic cells or endosperm cells that execute oriented divisions (14). For instance, without centrosomes or the PPB, the chloronemal apical cells of moss invariably orient the spindle along the cell's long axis and the division plane perpendicular to it (15, 16). Moreover, the recently reported trm678 mutant that does not form obvious PPBs only causes some loss of precision in division plane orientation and develops remarkably normally (17). Overall, the mechanism of division axis determination is still not well understood in plants. In this study, we aimed to uncover a fundamental mechanism of division plane determination in plants, and took the gametophore tissue of the moss Physcomitrella patens as model system (18). Multiple cell types in gametophores execute asymmetric cell di-vision, and the tissue shows 3D growth to make the stem and leaf-like structures (19). We followed MT organization and cell division in the living gametophore. PPBs were not observed in every cell, but regardless of the presence or absence of PPBs, discrete cyto-plasmic MT organizing centers (MTOC) were identified during prophase. The specific disruption of this structure during live im-aging showed that the structure is a key determinant of spindle and division plane orientation. Analogous to this finding, when the polar caps were disrupted in tobacco BY-2 cells, spindle orienta-tion was skewed and the cell plate was not accurately directed to the cortical division zone (CDZ) preestablished by the PPB.

The YUC genes are mainly expressed in meristems, young primordia, vascular tissues, and reproductive organs. Overexpression of each YUC gene leads to auxin overproduction, whereas disruption of a single YUC gene causes no obvious developmental defects. However, yuc1yuc4, yuc2yuc6, all of the triple and quadruple mutants of the four YUC genes, display severe defects in floral patterning, vascular formation, and other developmental processes. Furthermore, inactivation of the YUC genes leads to dramatically reduced expression of the auxin reporter DR5-GUS in tissues where the YUC genes are expressed. Moreover, the developmental defects of yuc1yuc4 and yuc1yuc2yuc6 are rescued by tissue-specific expression of the bacterial auxin biosynthesis gene iaaM, but not by exogenous auxin, demonstrating that spatially and temporally regulated auxin biosynthesis by the YUC genes is essential for the formation of floral organs and vascular tissues.},

Plant cells are immobile and establish position-dependent cell lineages that rely heavily on external cues. Central players are the hormones auxin and cytokinin, which balance cell division and differentiation during organogenesis. Transcription factors and miRNAs, many of which are mobile in plants, establish gene regulatory networks that communicate cell position and fate. Small peptide signaling also provides positional cues as new cell types emerge from stem cell division and progress through differentiation. These pathways recruit similar players for patterning different organs, emphasizing the modular nature of gene regulatory networks. Finally, we speculate on the outstanding questions in the field and discuss how they may be addressed by emerging technologies. 289},

Its defining features are the Casparian strips, belts of specialized cell wall material that generate an extracellular diffusion barrier. The mechanisms localizing Casparian strips are unknown. Here we identify and characterize a family of transmembrane proteins of previously unknown function. These 'CASPs' (Casparian strip membrane domain proteins) specifically mark a membrane domain that predicts the formation of Casparian strips.

Although several genes required for phragmoplast MT organization have been identified, the mechanisms that maintain the bipolarity of phragmoplasts remain poorly understood. Here, we show that engaging phragmoplast MTs in a bipolar fashion in protonemal cells of the moss Physcomitrella patens requires the conserved MT cross-linking protein MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN65 (MAP65). Simultaneous knockdown of the three MAP65s expressed in those cells severely compromised MT interdigitation at the phragmoplast equator after anaphase onset, resulting in the collapse of the phragmoplast in telophase. Cytokinetic vesicles initially localized to the anaphase midzone as normal but failed to further accumulate in the next several minutes, although the bipolarity of the MT array was preserved.

abstract = {Auxin participates in a multitude of developmental processes, as well as responses to environmental cues. Compared with other plant hormones, auxin exhibits a unique property, as it undergoes directional, cell-to-cell transport facilitated by plasma membrane-localized transport proteins. Among them, a prominent role has been ascribed to the PIN family of auxin efflux facilitators. PIN proteins direct polar auxin transport on account of their asymmetric subcellular localizations. In this review, we provide an overview of the multiple developmental roles of PIN proteins, including the atypical endoplasmic reticulum-localized members of the family, and look at the family from an evolutionary perspective. Next, we cover the cell biological and molecular aspects of PIN function, in particular the establishment of their polar subcellular localization. Hormonal and environmental inputs into the regulation of PIN action are summarized as well.},

However, the mechanisms by which cryptochrome signals regulate plant development remain obscure. In this study, cryptochrome functions were analyzed using the moss Physcomitrella patens . This moss has recently become known as the only plant species in which gene replacement occurs at a high frequency by homologous recombination. Two crypto-chrome genes were identified in Physcomitrella, and single and double disruptants of these genes were generated. Us-ing these disruptants, it was revealed that cryptochrome signals regulate many steps in moss development, including induction of side branching on protonema and gametophore induction and development. In addition, the disruption of cryptochromes altered auxin responses, including the expression of auxin-inducible genes. Cryptochrome disruptants were more sensitive to external auxin than wild type in a blue light–specific manner, suggesting that cryptochrome light signals repress auxin signals to control plant development.},

abstract = {Time-lapse observations of filamentous fern gametophytes were used to evaluate whether the plane of cell division is referable to the plane of minimal surface area before and during the transition to two-dimensional growth. Cell dimensions of the apical cell were related to the length/width ratios associated with minimal area in the transverse plane vs. longitudinal plane, by modeling the apical cell as a hemisphere subtended by a cylinder. Our working hypothesis predicts that filamentous growth is perpetuated by an apical cell geometry that makes the transverse division plane the orientation of minimal surface area, whereas the transition to two-dimensional growth (longitudinal division of the apical cell) occurs once the longitudinal plane becomes the position of minimal surface area. The predictions of this hypothesis are fulfilled regardless of variations in light intensity and light quality, the presence of regulators of metabolism, or whether the experimental perturbation causes a corresponding selective inhibition of the transition to two-dimensional growth. Thus, the control of the plane of cell division in this system seems to depend on thermodynamic considerations of surface area. Furthermore, we favor the conclusion that the role of the genome in the transition to two-dimensional growth involves its influence on apical cell dimensions rather than the induction of specific genes for specific morphogenetic mRNAs.},

abstract = {The advent of user-friendly instruments for measuring force/deflection curves of plant surfaces at high spatial resolution has resulted in a recent outpouring of reports of the 'Young's modulus' of plant cell walls. The stimulus for these mechanical measurements comes from biomechanical models of morphogenesis of meristems and other tissues, as well as single cells, in which cell wall stress feeds back to regulate microtubule organization, auxin transport, cellulose deposition, and future growth directionality. In this article I review the differences between elastic modulus and wall extensibility in the context of cell growth. Some of the inherent complexities, assumptions, and potential pitfalls in the interpretation of indentation force/deflection curves are discussed. Reported values of elastic moduli from surface indentation measurements appear to be 10- to {\textgreater}1000-fold smaller than realistic tensile elastic moduli in the plane of plant cell walls. Potential reasons for this disparity are discussed, but further work is needed to make sense of the huge range in reported values. The significance of wall stress relaxation for growth is reviewed and connected to recent advances and remaining enigmas in our concepts of how cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectins are assembled to make an extensible cell wall. A comparison of the loosening action of $\alpha$-expansin and Cel12A endoglucanase is used to illustrate two different ways in which cell walls may be made more extensible and the divergent effects on wall mechanics.},

abstract = {Auxin is a multifunctional hormone essential for plant development and pattern formation. A nuclear auxin-signaling system controlling auxin-induced gene expression is well established, but cytoplasmic auxin signaling, as in its coordination of cell polarization, is unexplored. We found a cytoplasmic auxin-signaling mechanism that modulates the interdigitated growth of Arabidopsis leaf epidermal pavement cells (PCs), which develop interdigitated lobes and indentations to form a puzzle-piece shape in a two-dimensional plane. PC interdigitation is compromised in leaves deficient in either auxin biosynthesis or its export mediated by PINFORMED 1 localized at the lobe tip. Auxin coordinately activates two Rho GTPases, ROP2 and ROP6, which promote the formation of complementary lobes and indentations, respectively. Activation of these ROPs by auxin occurs within 30 s and depends on AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1. These findings reveal Rho GTPase-based auxin-signaling mechanisms, which modulate the spatial coordination of cell expansion across a field of cells. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Here, we show that acentrosomal microtubule nucleation in plant cells involves a previously unknown regulatory step that determines the geometry of microtubule nucleation. Dynamic imaging of interphase cortical microtubules revealed that the ratio of branching to in-bundle microtubule nucleation on cortical microtubules is regulated by the Arabidopsis thaliana B'' subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, which is encoded by the TONNEAU2/FASS (TON2) gene. The probability of nucleation from gamma-tubulin complexes localized at the cell cortex was not affected by a loss of TON2 function, suggesting a specific role of TON2 in regulating the nucleation geometry. Both loss of TON2 function and ectopic targeting of TON2 to the plasma membrane resulted in defects in cell shape, suggesting the importance of TON2-mediated regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton in cell morphogenesis. Loss of TON2 function also resulted in an inability for cortical arrays to reorient in response to light stimulus, suggesting an essential role for TON2 and microtubule branching nucleation in reorganization of microtubule arrays. Our data establish TON2 as a regulator of interphase microtubule nucleation and provide experimental evidence for a novel regulatory step in the process of microtubule-dependent nucleation.},

Our findings suggest that the negative regulation of ER-family RLKs by TMM, which is an LRR receptor–like protein, is critical for proper stomatal differentiation.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell signaling is essential for many processes in plant growth and development, including coordination of cellular responses to developmental and environmental cues. Cumulative studies have demonstrated that peptide signaling plays a greater-than-anticipated role in such intercellular communication. Some peptides act as signals during plant growth and development, whereas others are involved in defense responses or symbiosis. Peptides secreted as signals often undergo posttranslational modification and prote-olytic processing to generate smaller peptides composed of approximately 10 amino acid residues. Such posttranslationally modified small-peptide signals constitute one of the largest groups of secreted peptide signals in plants. The location of the modification group incorporated into the peptides by specific modification enzymes and the peptide chain length defined by the processing enzymes are critical for biological function and receptor interaction. This review covers 20 years of research into posttranslationally modified small-peptide signals in plants.},

abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is absolutely required for pollen germination and tube growth, but little is known about the regulation of actin polymer concentrations or dynamics in pollen. Here, we report that latrunculin B (LATB), a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization, had effects on pollen that were distinct from those of cytochalasin D. The equilibrium dissociation constant measured for LATB binding to maize pollen actin was determined to be 74 nM. This high affinity for pollen actin suggested that treatment of pollen with LATB would have marked effects on actin function. Indeed, LATB inhibited maize pollen germination half-maximally at 50 nM, yet it blocked pollen tube growth at one-tenth of that concentration. Low concentrations of LATB also caused partial disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in germinated maize pollen, as visualized by light microscopy and fluorescent-phalloidin staining. The amounts of filamentous actin (F-actin) in pollen were quantified by measuring phalloidin binding sites, a sensitive assay that had not been used previously for plant cells. The amount of F-actin in maize pollen increased slightly upon germination, whereas the total actin protein level did not change. LATB treatment caused a dose-dependent depolymerization of F-actin in populations of maize pollen grains and tubes. Moreover, the same concentrations of LATB caused similar depolymerization in pollen grains before germination and in pollen tubes. These data indicate that the increased sensitivity of pollen tube growth to LATB was not due to general destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton or to decreases in F-actin amounts after germination. We postulate that germination is less sensitive to LATB than tube extension because the presence of a small population of LATB-sensitive actin filaments is critical for maintenance of tip growth but not for germination of pollen, or because germination is less sensitive to partial depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton.},

Plants with reduced DEK1 activity produce cotyledon epidermis with protodermal characteristics, despite showing normal growth and endoreduplication. Furthermore, in non-embryonic tissues (true leaves, sepals), DEK1 is required for epidermis differentiation maintenance. We show that the HD-ZIP IV family of epidermis-specific differentiation-promoting transcription factors are key, albeit indirect, targets of DEK1 activity. We propose a model in which DEK1 influences HD-ZIP IV gene expression, and thus epidermis differentiation, by promoting cell adhesion and communication in the epidermis.},

abstract = {The phytohormone auxin is involved in almost all developmental processes in land plants. Most, if not all, of these processes are mediated by changes in gene expression. Auxin acts on gene expression through a short nuclear path-way that converges upon the activation of a family of DNA-binding transcription factors. These AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs) are thus the effector of auxin response and translate the chemical signal into the regulation of a defined set of genes. Given the limited number of dedicated components in auxin signaling, distinct properties among the ARF family probably contribute to the establishment of multiple unique auxin responses in plant development. In the two decades following the identification of the first ARF in Arabidopsis, much has been learnt about how these transcription factors act, and how they generate unique auxin responses. Progress in genetics, biochemistry, genom-ics, and structural biology has helped to develop mechanistic models for ARF action. However, despite intensive efforts, many central questions are yet to be addressed. In this review, we highlight what has been learnt about ARF transcription factors, and identify outstanding questions and challenges for the near future.},

Although auxin and its intercellular transport by PIN family efflux carriers are primary regulators of sporophytic shoot development in flowering plants, the extent of conservation in PIN function within the land plants and the mechanisms regulating bryophyte gametophytic shoot development are largely unknown. Results We have found that treating gametophytic shoots of the moss Physcomitrella patens with exogenous auxins and auxin transport inhibitors disrupts apical function and leaf development. Two plasma membrane-targeted PIN proteins are expressed in leafy shoots, and pin mutants resemble plants treated with auxins or auxin transport inhibitors. PIN-mediated auxin transport regulates apical cell function, leaf initiation, leaf shape, and shoot tropisms in moss gametophytes. pin mutant sporophytes are sometimes branched, reproducing a phenotype only previously seen in the fossil record and in rare natural moss variants. Conclusions Our results show that PIN-mediated auxin transport is an ancient, conserved regulator of shoot development.},

abstract = {Development in multicellular organisms requires the organized generation of differences. A universal mechanism for creating such differences is asymmetric cell division. In plants, as in animals, asymmetric divisions are correlated with the production of cellular diversity and pattern; however, structural constraints imposed by plant cell walls and the absence of homologs of known animal or fungal cell polarity regulators necessitates that plants utilize new molecules and mechanisms to create asymmetries. Here, we identify BASL, a novel regulator of asymmetric divisions in Arabidopsis. In asymmetrically dividing stomatal-lineage cells, BASL accumulates in a polarized crescent at the cell periphery before division, and then localizes differentially to the nucleus and a peripheral crescent in self-renewing cells and their sisters after division. BASL presence at the cell periphery is critical for its function, and we propose that BASL represents a plant-specific solution to the challenge of asymmetric cell division. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Proper tissue function and regeneration rely on robust spatial and temporal control of biophysical and biochemical microenvironmental cues through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Biomaterials are rapidly being developed to display and deliver stem-cell-regulatory signals in a precise and near-physiological fashion, and serve as powerful artificial microenvironments in which to study and instruct stem-cell fate both in culture and in vivo. Further synergism of cell biological and biomaterials technologies promises to have a profound impact on stem-cell biology and provide insights that will advance stem-cell-based clinical approaches to tissue regeneration. Stem cells are defined by their ability to self-renew and produce special ized progeny 1,2. Consequently, they are the most versatile and promising cell source for the regeneration of aged, injured and diseased tissues. Embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells are obtained from three different sources and have different advantages (Fig. 1). However, despite the remarkable potential clinical applications of each of these stem-cell populations, their use is currently hindered by hurdles that must be cleared 3 (Table 1). These obstacles may appear daunting, but nature has strategies to surmount them in vivo. Thus, a major goal is to develop new culture-based approaches, using advanced biomaterials, that more closely mimic what the body already does so well and promote differentiation of pluripotent cells or propagation of specialized adult stem cells without loss of 'stemness'. An increasing emphasis on design principles drawn from basic mechanisms of cell-matrix interactions and cell signalling has now set the stage for the successful application of biomaterials to stem-cell biology. This application has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of extrinsic regulators of cell fate, as matrices can be made using technologies that are sufficiently versatile to allow recapitulation of features of stem-cell microenvironments, or niches, down almost to the molecular detail 4. In the body, adult stem cells reside within instructive, tissue-specific niches that physically localize them and maintain their stem-cell fate 5,6 (Fig. 2). The key function of stem-cell niches is to maintain a constant number of slowly dividing stem cells during homeostasis by balan cing the proportions of quiescent and activated cells. On insult (that is, injury, disease or damage), stem cells exit the niche and then proliferate extensively , self-renew and differentiate to regenerate the tissue. Within the niche, stem cells are thought to be exposed to complex, spatially and temporally controlled biochemical mixtures of soluble chemo kines, cytokines and growth factors, as well as insoluble transmembrane receptor ligands and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (Fig. 2). In addition to understanding this biochemical signalling regulatory network, it is key to appreciate the biophysical properties of the niche, including matrix mechanical properties and architecture (topographical cues), to elucidate the role of niche elements 7,8. To shed light on the mechanisms that regulate stem cells, approaches that allow the study of stem-cell function in response to isolated components of a complex system-that is, models that simplify it-are crucial. Biomaterials approaches, in combination with other technologies such as microfabrication and microfluidics, are well suited to assist studies of stem-cell biology through the creation of evolving systems that allow key variables to be systematically altered and their influence on stem-cell fate analysed. Thus, biomaterials technologies provide the exciting possibility of deconstructing and then reconstructing niches, allowing quantitative analysis of stem-cell behaviour in a manner not previously possible. In this Review, we use specific examples to outline the various means by which biomaterials technologies have been, and could be, used to construct versatile model systems for stem-cell biology, as well as to develop carriers for stem cells and biomolecules, facilitating the in vivo use of stem cells in tissue engineering. We focus on hydrogels as one emerging and physiologically relevant class of biomaterial, although we acknowledge that other biomaterials have been, and will be, used in these applications. For a more comprehensive understanding of the diverse types and applications of biomaterials in stem-cell biology and bioengineering, we refer readers to several recent reviews 9-15. We anticipate that insight will be gained from studies using biomaterials that allow the enhanced differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells into tissue-specific differentiated states and the propagation of adult stem cells without losing their stem-cell properties. Designing 2D materials to control stem-cell fate in vitro In vitro stem-cell research is carried out with cells cultured on flat substrates coated, for example, with collagen or laminin, on feeder-cell layers (that is, in co-culture experiments) or on or within hydrogels made from naturally derived ECM components (for example collagen or Matrigel). By far the most frequently used material for the culture of stem cells is rigid polystyrene tissue-culture plastic. Cells in plastic dishes are typically exposed to soluble factors in liquid media. These culture conditions are very different from the conditions experienced by cells in the body, where they are associated with anchored molecules presented in close proximity to surrounding cell surfaces and contained within an ECM that creates a relatively soft microenvironment. The constraints imposed on stem cells within the three-dimensional (3D) niche have effects that are still being explored and should not be ignored. With this goal in mind, two-dimensional (2D) biomaterial culture systems are highly advantageous as a simplified approach to deconstructing the niche and identifying and assessing the effects of individual niche components on stem-cell fate (Fig. 3).},

Flowering plants have an indeterminate meristem in their diploid generation, whereas the common ancestor of land plants is inferred to have formed an indeterminate meristem in its haploid generation, as observed in the extant basal land plants, bryophytes, including mosses. It is hypothesized that the underlying gene networks for the diploid meristem were initially present in the haploid generation of the basal land plants and were eventually co-opted for expression in the diploid generation. In flowering plants, the class 1 KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) transcription factors are essential for the function of the indeterminate apical meristem. Here, we show that the class 1 KNOX orthologs function in the diploid organ, with determinate growth in the moss Physcomitrella patens, but do not function in the haploid indeterminate meristem. We propose that the genetic networks governing the indeterminate meristem in land plants are variable, and the networks governing the diploid indeterminate meristem with the class 1 KNOX genes likely evolved de novo in the flowering plant lineage. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The establishment of new cell lineages during development often requires a symmetry-breaking event. An asymmetric division in the epidermis of plants initiates a lineage that ultimately produces stomatal guard cells. Stomata are pores in the epidermis that serve as the main conduits for gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere; they are critical for photosynthesis and exert a major influence on global carbon and water cycles. Recent studies implicated intercellular signalling in preventing the inappropriate production of stomatal complexes. Genes required to make stomata, however, remained elusive. Here we report the identification of a gene, SPEECHLESS (SPCH), encoding a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is necessary and sufficient for the asymmetric divisions that establish the stomatal lineage in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that SPCH and two paralogues are successively required for the initiation, proliferation and terminal differentiation of cells in the stomatal lineage. The stomatal bHLHs define a molecular pathway sufficient to create one of the key cell types in plants. Similar molecules and regulatory mechanisms are used during muscle and neural development, highlighting a conserved use of closely related bHLHs for cell fate specification and differentiation.},

abstract = {Auxins represent an important class of plant hormone that regulate plant development. Plants use specialized carrier proteins to transport the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to target tissues. To date, efflux carrier-mediated polar auxin transport has been assumed to represent the sole mode of long distance IAA movement. Localization of the auxin permease AUX1 in the Arabidopsis root apex has revealed a novel phloem-based IAA transport pathway. AUX1, asymmetrically localized to the plasma membrane of root protophloem cells, is proposed to promote the acropetal, post-phloem movement of auxin to the root apex. MS analysis shows that IAA accumulation in aux1 mutant root apices is impaired, consistent with an AUX1 phloem unloading function. AUX1 localization to columella and lateral root cap tissues of the Arabidopsis root apex reveals that the auxin permease regulates a second IAA transport pathway. Expression studies using an auxin-regulated reporter suggest that AUX1 is necessary for root gravitropism by facilitating basipetal auxin transport to distal elongation zone tissues.},

The root pericycle represents a unique tissue with conditional meristematic activity, and its tight control determines initiation of lateral organs. Here we show that the meristematic activity of the pericycle is constrained by the interaction with the adjacent endodermis. Release of these restraints by elimination of endodermal cells by single-cell ablation triggers the pericycle to re-enter the cell cycle. We found that endodermis removal substitutes for the phytohormone auxin-dependent initiation of the pericycle meristematic activity. However, auxin is indispensable to steer the cell division plane orientation of new organ-defining divisions. We propose a dual, spatiotemporally distinct role for auxin during lateral root initiation. In the endodermis, auxin releases constraints arising from cell-to-cell interactions that compromise the pericycle meristematic activity, whereas, in the pericycle, auxin defines the orientation of the cell division plane to initiate lateral roots.},

@article{Bhatia2016,
abstract = {The periodic formation of plant organs such as leaves and flowers gives rise to intricate patterns that have fascinated biologists and mathematicians alike for hundreds of years [1]. The plant hormone auxin plays a central role in establishing these patterns by promoting organ formation at sites where it accumulates due to its polar, cell-to-cell transport [2–6]. Although experimental evidence as well as modeling suggest that feedback from auxin to its transport direction may help specify phyllotactic patterns [7–12], the nature of this feedback remains unclear [13]. Here we reveal that polarization of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) is regulated by the auxin response transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) [14]. We find that in the shoot, cell polarity patterns follow MP expression, which in turn follows auxin distribution patterns. By perturbing MP activity both globally and locally, we show that localized MP activity is necessary for the generation of polarity convergence patterns and that localized MP expression is sufficient to instruct PIN1 polarity directions non-cell autonomously, toward MP-expressing cells. By expressing MP in the epidermis of mp mutants, we further show that although MP activity in a single-cell layer is sufficient to promote polarity convergence patterns, MP in sub-epidermal tissues helps anchor these polarity patterns to the underlying cells. Overall, our findings reveal a patterning module in plants that determines organ position by orienting transport of the hormone auxin toward cells with high levels of MP-mediated auxin signaling. We propose that this feedback process acts broadly to generate periodic plant architectures.},

abstract = {Cell division patterning is important to determine body shape in plants. Nuclear auxin signaling mediated by AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors af-fects plant growth and development through regulation of cell division, elongation and differentiation. The evolution-ary origin of the ARF-mediated pathway dates back to at least the common ancestor of bryophytes and other land plants. The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha has three phylogenetically distinct ARFs: MpARF1, the sole 'activator' ARF; and MpARF2 and MpARF3, two 'repressor' ARFs. Genetic screens for auxin-resistant mutants revealed that loss of MpARF1 function conferred auxin insensitivity. Mparf1 mutants showed reduced auxin-inducible gene ex-pression and various developmental defects, including thallus twisting and gemma malformation. We further inves-tigated the role of MpARF1 in gemma development, which is traceable at the cellular level. In wild-type plants, a gemma initial first undergoes several transverse divisions to generate a single-celled stalk and a gemma proper, followed by rather synchronous longitudinal divisions in the latter. Mparf1 mu-tants often contained multicelled stalks and showed defects in the execution and timing of the longitudinal divisions. While wild-type gemmae finally generate two meristem notches, Mparf1 gemmae displayed various numbers of ec-topic meristems. These results suggest that MpARF1 regu-lates formative cell divisions and axis formation through auxin responses. The mechanism for activator ARF regula-tion of pattern formation may be shared in land plants and therefore important for the general acquisition of three-di-mensional body plans.},

@article{Higashiyama2015,
abstract = {During sexual reproduction of flowering plants, pollen tube guidance by pistil tissue is critical for the delivery of nonmotile sperm cells to female gametes. Multistep controls of pollen tube guidance can be divided into two phases: preovular guidance and ovular guidance. During preovular guidance, various female molecules, including stimulants for pollen germination and pollen tube growth, are provided to support tube growth toward the ovary, where the ovules are located. After entering the ovary, pollen tubes receive directional cues from their respective target ovules, including attractant pep-tides for precise, species-preferential attraction. Successful pollen tube guidance in the pistil requires not only nutritional and directional controls but also competency controls to make pollen tubes responsive to guidance cues, regulation to terminate growth once a pollen tube arrives at the target, and strategies to stop ovular attraction depending on the fertilization of female gametes.},

@article{Peaucelle2011a,
abstract = {Tissue mechanics have been shown to play a key role in the regulation of morphogenesis in animals [1-4] and may have an equally important role in plants [5-9]. The aerial organs of plants are formed at the shoot apical meristem following a specific phyllotactic pattern [10]. The initiation of an organ from the meristem requires a highly localized irreversible surface deformation, which depends on the demethylesterification of cell wall pectins [11]. Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate whether these chemical changes lead to changes in tissue mechanics. By mapping the viscoelasticity and elasticity in living meristems, we observed increases in tissue elasticity, correlated with pectin demethylesterification, in primordia and at the site of incipient organs. Measurements of tissue elasticity at various depths showed that, at the site of incipient primordia, the first increases occurred in subepidermal tissues. The results support the following causal sequence of events: (1) demethylesterification of pectin is triggered in subepidermal tissue layers, (2) this contributes to an increase in elasticity of these layers - the first observable mechanical event in organ initiation, and (3) the process propagates to the epidermis during the outgrowth of the organ. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Viaene2014a,
abstract = {The emergence and radiation of multicellular land plants was driven by crucial innovations to their body plans [1]. The directional transport of the phytohormone auxin represents a key, plant-specific mechanism for polarization and patterning in complex seed plants [2-5]. Here, we show that already in the early diverging land plant lineage, as exemplified by the moss Physcomitrella patens, auxin transport by PIN transporters is operational and diversified into ER-localized and plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses revealed that PIN-dependent intercellular auxin transport in Physcomitrella mediates crucial developmental transitions in tip-growing filaments and waves of polarization and differentiation in leaf-like structures. Plasma membrane PIN proteins localize in a polar manner to the tips of moss filaments, revealing an unexpected relation between polarization mechanisms in moss tip-growing cells and multicellular tissues of seed plants. Our results trace the origins of polarization and auxin-mediated patterning mechanisms and highlight the crucial role of polarized auxin transport during the evolution of multicellular land plants.},

@article{Flanders1990,
abstract = {To investigate the spatial relationship between the nucleus and the cortical division site, epidermal cells were selected in which the separation between these two areas is large. Avoiding enzyme treatment and air drying, Datura stramonium cells were labeled with antitubulin antibodies and the three-dimensional aspect of the cytoskeletons was reconstructed using computer-aided optical sectioning. In vacuolated cells preparing for division, the nucleus migrates into the center of the cell, suspended by transvacuolar strands. These strands are now shown to contain continuous bundles of microtubules which bridge the nucleus to the cortex. These nucleus-radiating microtubules adopt different configurations in cells of different shape. In elongated cells with more or less parallel side walls, oblique strands radiating from the nucleus to the long side walls are presumably unstable, for they are progressively realigned into a transverse disc (the phragmosome) as broad, cortical, preprophase bands (PPBs) become tighter. The phragmosome and the PPB are both known predictors of the division plane and our observations indicate that they align simultaneously in elongated epidermal cells. These observations suggest another hypothesis: that the PPB may contain microtubules polymerized from the nuclear surface. In elongated cells, the majority of the radiating microtubules, therefore, come to anchor the nucleus in the transverse plane, consistent with the observed tendency of such cells to divide perpendicular to the long axis. In nonrectangular isodiametric epidermal cells, which approximate regular hexagons in section, the radial microtubular strands emanating from the nucleus tend to remain associated with the middle of each subtending cell wall. The strands are not reorganized into a single dominant transverse bar, but remain as a starlike array until mitosis. PPBs in these cells are not as tight; they may only be a sparse accumulation of microtubules, even forming along non-diametrical radii. This arrangement is consistent with the irregular division patterns observed in epidermal mosaics of isodiametric D. stramonium cells. The various conformations of the radial strands can be modeled by springs held in two-dimensional hexagonal frames, and by soap bubbles in three-dimensional hexagonal frames, suggesting that the division plane may, by analogy, be selected by minimal path criteria. Such behavior offers a cytoplasmic explanation of long-standing empirically derived "rules" which state that the new cell wall tends to meet the maternal wall at right angles. The radial premitotic strands and their analogues avoid taking the longer path to the vertex of an angle where a cross wall is already present between neighboring cells. The resultant tendency to form three-rayed vertices rather than intercrossing septa helps explain the hexagonal packing of plant cells.},
